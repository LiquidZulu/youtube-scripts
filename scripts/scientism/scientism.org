* Introduction
Science isn't real. Woah! Slow down, don't click off just yet! I am not some crazed lunatic flat earther or anything, I myself am a physics student. I find it to be a very useful and interesting field. So what on earth am I going on about then, how can one hold that science isn't real and that it is useful and interesting?

* Definitions
First, I need to get some definitions out of the way so that the claim I am making is clear.

When I am talking about science not being /real/ I am talking about whether it corresponds to objective reality. Anything that is not objectively, a priori true, is not real in my book, at least in the context of this conversation.
