## Introduction

It&rsquo;s the late 9th century, and you are a peasant farmer living in Norway, your country is in chaos, King Harold Fairhair is seeking to overturn the long-standing tradition of local independence that your people have come to know and love.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Through alliances with northern jarl&rsquo;s he has started subjugating other regional kings, local leaders, and countless free farmers, claiming to be the overlord of all of Norway. This is bad news for your livelihood, having such a power-hungry tyrant ruling over you will certainly bring with it yet more expropriation of your wealth, evidenced his newly implemented policy of property taxes over people who directly owned their land.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> This is something that you just can&rsquo;t afford to stick around for, but where can you turn? Much of Europe is also being ravaged by viking kings, and those places that are able to resist viking invasions have their own local tyrants to deal with. Then you get an idea&#x2014;you heard about a place called Iceland that has no king and yet has been able to resist viking invasion for quite some time, you decide to join other settlers in attempting to form a community there. Stick through to the end to learn of the trials that these settlers faced and how they dealt with them.


<a id="orga3d9b5b"></a>

## Law in the Icelandic Commonwealth

As the settlers came from many different parts of Europe the icelandic legal tradition was developed as a mixture of many different legal traditions and as David Friedman notes:<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>

> Legal conflicts were of great interest to the medieval Icelanders: Njal, the eponymous hero of the most famous of the sagas, is not a warrior but a lawyer&#x2013;&ldquo;so skilled in law that no one was considered his equal.&rdquo; In the action of the sagas, law cases play as central a role as battles.

The structure of rights enforcement that the Icelanders came to was heavily market-oriented, men would engage in a contractual relationship with a chieftain, called a goði who would act as a religious leader and an advocate in the event of any legal conflicts. The men who subscribed to a given goði were called his þingmenn, and importantly, this relationship was not territorial, the goði had no claim to the property of his þingmenn and they were free to transfer their allegiance to another goði at will.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> Iceland was not, however, entirely adherent to natural law anarchism, there did exist a national legislative body, called the lögrétta, which was made up of legislative offices of the goðar which were called goðorð, where each goðorð may be occupied by multiple goðar at one time.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup> These offices were treated as property and could be traded between different men or passed onto heirs. However, there was not free entry into the lögrétta, one could not simply declare himself a goði and establish a goðorð to start voting at the lögrétta, new chieftaincies needed to be approved by the existing goðar.

However, it is still the case that this legislative body was relatively very limited in scope, as Roderick Long notes:<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>

> This parliament had no budget and no employees; it met only two weeks per year.

And Jared Diamond points out that:<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>

> Medieval Iceland had no bureaucrats, no taxes, no police, and no army. … Of the normal functions of governments elsewhere, some did not exist in Iceland, and others were privatized, including fire-fighting, criminal prosecutions and executions, and care of the poor.

Law in Iceland was seen as a private matter, dealing with disputes purely through arbitration at courts known as þings, these þings were either embedded in the official state structure, or were set up privately by conflicting parties and their goðar.

> So imbued were the Icelanders with the norms of conflict resolution through arbitration that they dealt with haunted houses in the same way – trying the ghosts for trespassing, in the confident expectation that, if found guilty, a good Icelandic ghost would respect the verdict of the court and peacefully depart!<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup>


<a id="org0dd942a"></a>

## Mutual Aid in the Icelandic Commonwealth

The provision of mutual aid in Iceland was in the form of the hreppar, a small communal unit that acted to mitigate against many common threats facing the free farmers. The exact inner-workings of the hreppar is unknown, but we do know that they provided support for the poor and orphaned, insured against fire damage and loss of livestock due to disease, and potentially many of the other insurable threats that would face people at this time. To gain entry to the hreppar a farmer would need the reccommendation of a member, and once in dues would have to be paid, similarly to the mutual aid that was developed in the United States far later. However, it does seem that once affiliated with a hreppar, farmers were unable to change their affiliation to another one at will, making it a less-than-ideal relationship.


<a id="orgd7093ae"></a>

## The Fall of the Icelandic Commonwealth.

The system eventually broke down into civil warfare in the 11th century thanks to a consolodation of power into the hands of five families. These families were able to attain regional monopolies, seizing much of the farmland and chieftaincies, thus transforming into warring states. However, even with these new mini-states forming and coming to blows the level of violence was fairly low, as Friedman notes:

> During more than fifty years of what the Icelanders themselves perceived as intolerably violent civil war, leading to the collapse of the traditional system, the average number of people killed or executed each year appears, on a per capita basis, to be roughly equal to the current rate of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter in the United States.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>

This level of violence was perceived by the Icelanders to be so intolerable that they invited King Haakon of Norway to govern them. But how exactly did this consolodation of power come into being? A major culprit is the introduction of the tithe in 1096, made possible due to the countries conversion to Christianity a century earlier. As long explains:<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup>

> &#x2026;the tithe – [used] to pay church officials and maintain church buildings – was Iceland&rsquo;s first real tax. (Previous &ldquo;taxes&rdquo; generally turn out on closer inspection to be voluntary exchanges of fees for services.) Assessed at 1% of the payer&rsquo;s property, it was also Iceland&rsquo;s first graduated tax (earlier fees were one-size-fits-all), and so [it] took in much more revenue. Most importantly, the tithe lacked a competitive element. Recall the non-territorial character of a chieftain&rsquo;s jurisdiction: a chieftain&rsquo;s temptations to self-aggrandizement were kept in check by the knowledge that if he acquired delusions of grandeur or charged too high a price for his services, his clients could abandon him for a rival. But the tithe was territorial; all those who lived in the vicinity of a particular church building had to pay for its upkeep, and were not at liberty to transfer their support elsewhere. The catch is that the portion of tithe revenue allocated to maintaining church buildings went not to the official church hierarchy but to the wealthy private owners (usually chieftains) of stadhir, &ldquo;churchsteads,&rdquo; i.e., plots of land on which churches had been built. The tithe was a property tax; but chieftaincies, though marketable commodities, were exempt – as were the churchsteads themselves, predominantly owned by chieftains. (The parliament that enacted the tithe law was of course composed entirely of chieftains.)
> 
> The tithe thus did more than just increase the income of the chieftains; it decoupled that income from accountability. Economic inequalities per se are not a serious threat to liberty so long as they operate in a genuine market context, where the way to gain and maintain wealth is to please one&rsquo;s customers; before the introduction of the tithe, a chieftain who proved too power-hungry would alienate his customers and so suffer financial discipline. But chieftains who owned churchsteads now had a captive market, and so were freed from all competitive restraints on their accumulation of wealth and power. Through buying off or intimidating less wealthy chieftains, the top families were able to gain control of multiple chieftaincies. This gave them a lock on the parliament, enabling them to pass still further taxes; it also decreased competition among chieftains, allowing them to charge monopoly prices and drive their clients into a serf-like state of debt and dependence.
> 
> The Icelandic system did fall through an inherent flaw, then, but not the one Diamond imagines; the Free State failed, not through having too much privatization, but through having too little. The tithe, and particularly the portion allotted to churchstead maintenance, represented a monopolistic, non-competitive element in the system. The introduction of the tithe was in turn made possible by yet another non-competitive element: the establishment of an official state church which everyone was legally bound to support. Finally, buying up chieftaincies would have availed little if there had been free entry into the chieftaincy profession; instead, the number of chieftains was set by law, and the creation of new chieftaincies could be approved only by parliament – i.e., by the existing chieftains, who were naturally less than eager to encourage competitors. It is precisely those respects in which the Free State was least privatized and decentralized that led to its downfall – while its more privatized aspects delayed that downfall for three centuries.

As Hoppe has explained,<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup> unlike firms in a free market, who live or die by public demand, the state lives or dies by public *opinion*. In short, as the state is made up of a relatively far smaller subset of the population than those producers, homesteaders, and traders who are expropriated by the state, it relies on a state of favourable public opinion in order to continue its expropriation. Hoppe describes this as being analogous to the Marxist notion of class consciousness&#x2014;that is, on the one hand when the class consciousness of the expropriated class is low their opinion of the exploitative methods of the state is that such exploitation is a good thing (or at least something that should not be actively resisted); and on the other hand when class consciousness is high public opinion is such that the criminal conduct of the state in its exploitation is something that is to be resisted.

We may apply this analysis to medieval Iceland as a means to determine the root of its failure more fully. Initially as the settlers in the 9th century set up the legal apparatus, the public opinion of icelanders was very much in line with natural law&#x2014;that is, many Icelanders were directly escaping exploitation of states back home, and thus would be apt to resist any attempts at exploitation in their new home. This is why we see no taxation in early iceland. Unfortunately, however, the men of Iceland did not have a perfect grasp on private property or economics and were rather proto-democratic in the way they set up the lögrétta where the goðorð would vote to &ldquo;decide&rdquo; law and would have to vote to determine whether a new goðorð would be allowed into the party. Such a monopolistic apparatus did indeed plant the seeds for future growth in statism as Long has pointed out above. However, such a growth could only come about if public opinion was in its favour, which occurred due to the islands conversion to Christianity. The newly christian population had a level of class consciousness such that the tithe was able to be introduced without active resistence from the expropriated, these new monopolistic earnings of the goðar then allowed them to begin waging wars which further pushed public opinion in the favour of alternative expropriation at the hands of King Haakon IV. Ultimately a stronger grasp on natural law could have saved the commonwealth and even pushed it into total anarchy&#x2014;thus I re-iterate Long&rsquo;s point that it was specifically those aspects in which Iceland was statist that lead to its eventual downfall.

### Introduction

-   book focuses on formative first centuries of the Old Icelandic Free State, extending from the tenth to the middle of the thirteenth century.
-   settlers came either from mainland Scandanavia or from Viking settlements in the British Isles
-   newcomers forced to adapt to harsh environment
-   Consensus played a prominent role in decision-making

> Law in medieval Iceland touched virtually all aspects of social intercourse, yet it was not implemented by the force of an executive arm of government. The operation of law was connected to advocacy, a core dynamic in the society which, together with ‘friendships’ (called vinfengi) and kinship ties, did much to shape social behaviour. The society’s cultural focus on law, the crucial role played by advocacy and arbitrations, the course of legal and political decision­making, and the choices that individuals faced between violence and compromise in a feuding society are among the issues explored in the book.

### An Immigrant Society

Years ago the legal historian James Bryce wrote<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup> that medieval Iceland

> is an almost unique instance of a community whose culture and creative power flourished independently of any favouring material conditions, and indeed under conditions in the highest degree unfavourable. Nor ought it to be less interesting to the student of politics and laws as having produced a Constitution unlike any other whereof records remain, and a body of law so elaborate and complex that it is hard to believe that it existed among men whose chief occupation was to kill one another.

-   initial settlement was by the landnåmsmenn (land-takers) who were either from Scandanavia or the British Isles (there are Celtic names in the Sagas such as Njáll/Níall/Neil and Kormákr/Cormac).
-   Many of the more prominent settlers used their own ships, though it is also possible that other ships ferried people across to iceland.
-   The landnåmsmenn came to mostly uninhabited and uncultivated land, save for a few Irish monks, who arrived earlier in their native curachs seeking solitude.
-   These monks,named papar (sing. papi) by the later icelanders,<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup> either left of their own accord or were driven out by the new settlers.
-   Section on leadership (page 13 [37 in total]) is handy for quotes


<a id="org8a19dd8"></a>

### A Devolving and Evolving Social Order

-   Contained statist and non-statist elements

> The immigrants who founded Iceland became participants in what in some ways was a headless or stateless society. Early Iceland can loosely be so described because its leaders, the goðar, wielded little executive power and did not rule over territorial units. The concept of statelessness, however, should not be carried too far. Iceland did have specific elements of statehood: a formal national legislature (the lögrétta) and a well-defined judicial system that embraced the entire country. Social stratification, although it existed, was restrained by the absence of kings or even regional princes or warlords. Among the landed there were differences in wealth and prominence. Distinct cleavages existed between landowners and landless people and between free men and slaves. Although early Iceland was essentially headless, it did have distinct aspects of an embryonic state. How can this mingling of attributes be explained? The answer is that early Iceland experienced a complicated evolution. This dynamic has been largely overlooked, yet it holds the key to understanding Iceland’s medieval society and culture.
> 
> The mixture of state and stateless existed because Free State Iceland was the product of two different cultural forces. On the one hand, it inherited the tradition and the vocabulary of statehood from its European origins. On the other, Iceland was headless because of the class values of the immigrants. On this very large island, a late Iron Age European culture group took advantage of the safety afforded by the North Atlantic to eliminate the hierarchy of command and the taxation necessary for defence. As a result the society simplified, moving down a few rungs on the ladder of social complexity.
> 
> What has not been recognized about the settlement of Iceland is that the evolutionary machinery was in many ways running in reverse. Rather than a simple society that had reached a modest level of complexity as part of an evolutionary progression, Iceland at the start went the other way. Initially it ‘devolved’, shedding most of the aristocratic strata of Viking Age society. In their own eyes the tenth-century settlers and lawgivers almost certainly had limited goals. By emphasizing the rights of free farmers, they adjusted social arrangements, making them less complex than in Norway with its king, aristocrats, regional warlords and legally defined levels of free and unfree. Reflecting the desires of landowning farmers, Icelandic institutions eliminated a significant number of the roles played by elites and overlords. By avoiding the formation of self-perpetuating executive structures, the farmers collectively retained control over coercive power. In doing so they denied would-be elites the crucial state function of monopolizing force. Leadership was limited to local chieftains who often operated like ‘big men’, individuals whose authority often was temporary.

#### Ranking, Hierarchy and Wealth

-   slavery mostly died out in the eleventh century

> Despite the obvious connection between wealth and power, there is little indication that Iceland’s Viking Age chieftains enjoyed a significant income through either taxes or tributes from the farmers. The labour of slaves, landless workers and tenant farmers, and the rental of property and livestock, were significant sources of wealth for all prominent farmers. Many free farmers, like the goðar, were prosperous landowners who were frequently called upon to act as advocates or arbitrators. Over time, however, chieftains proved to be the best qualified people for this public endeavour. They found a significant and, to some degree, a proprietary source of revenue by actively participating in dispute management and conflict settlement.
> 
> &#x2026;
> 
> The outward trappings of rank in Viking Age Iceland were so few that it is frequently difficult to determine whether a prominent individual was a chieftain or just a farmer. In the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries (that is, after the Viking period) the situation began to change, and a movement toward rigid stratification and incipient statehood can be perceived.
> 
> &#x2026;
> 
> That a chieftain might gain widespread territorial control, thus centralizing political and governmental power in a region, was always a threat. This development was avoided, however, until the late twelfth century and, in some regions, the early thirteenth century by a system of checks and balances aimed at limiting the power of individual chieftains. Farmers, as in the example of conflict between the two chieftains Arnkel goði and Snorri goði from Eyrbyggja saga (see Chapter 6), openly granted authority to their goðar, and during much of Iceland’s early history dissatisfied farmers could take authority from one leader and give it to another.

#### Complex Culture and Simple Economy

> The knowledge of Scandinavia’s expansive mother culture was embedded in early Iceland’s underlying social codes and values. Culturally, the early Icelanders inherited centuries of northern European social development. As part of this heritage their community started out with, and soon expanded upon, complicated constitutional concepts as well as sophisticated laws of contract, property and tort. They also produced a world-class literature. It is in regard to economics that early Iceland was in many ways simple. On the far margin of the extensive international commerce of Viking Age Scandinavia, Iceland, with its dependence on pastoralism and hunting and gathering, became largely self-sufficient.
> 
> When comparing early Iceland with other societies, one might keep in mind additional factors. Unlike early Ireland with its history of chieftains and warlords dating from at least the Bronze Age, medieval Iceland was not a tribal society, and the authority of its leaders did not depend on ownership of or rule over defined territorial units. What, then, was Iceland? Briefly, it was a society whose development was determined by the dynamics of its Scandinavian past and immigrant experiences. Having shed a good part of the military and political structures of Viking Age culture, the settlers and their descendants built a society on a combination of choices rarely, if ever, possible over so long a period of time on the European mainland. Beginning in the tenth century, the Icelanders established a rudimentary state structure that declared to the outside world the island’s independent status. Internally, with most executive institutions in private hands, the country operated with only the bare bones of public institutions of statehood. Internal cohesion was maintained by stressing lateral social arrangements. These were invigorated by the general acceptance of the principle, pleasing to farmers, that government was to be dominated by the requirements of consensus rather than by the authority of overlords.
> 
> Cultural focus, a long-established anthropological concept, is the tendency of every culture to exhibit more complexity and a wider scope in some of its aspects and institutions than in others. When a society focuses on a particular dimension of culture, that dimension is more likely to develop new ways and to generate innovation because more activity and closer scrutiny are directed to it than to other aspects. In Iceland the cultural focus was on law, and disorder was avoided through dependence on legalistic solutions arrived at through arbitration and court cases.
> 
> Icelandic law was based on custom, and it proved to be highly adaptable to change over time. To an unusual degree, law became the catalyst in the conceptualizing of life outside the family. Law set the parameters of successful arbitration, and served as an element of continuity throughout Iceland’s medieval history. This reliance was more pronounced in times of crisis and dispute, when judicial process was used as a model even in private arbitrations, thus supplying the means to reconcile the most divisive forces within the society. An example (discussed in Chapter 16) is the conversion to Christianity in the year 1000. This potentially explosive situation was channelled into the normal procedures of legalistic dispute processing, where it was treated as a feud between two groups and settled at the Althing through negotiation and compromise.

#### Privatization of Power in the Tenth Century

> Leadership functioned in a kind of market economy, with the forces of supply and demand playing a significant role. Candidates competed for the supporters necessary to claim a chieftaincy (goðorð), which offered prestige and an opportunity to amass wealth and power through privileged access to processes of law. Depending on the acumen of the individual, the results could be significant. Alliance with a chieftain gave a farmer the promise of present or future services. In many ways, it was a pay-as-you-go system. Services, or the expectation of them, were negotiable and exchangeable, and had monetary value.
> 
> With coercive power privatized, Icelanders did not need to pay taxes for the upkeep of state institutions of enforcement. The solution was economically efficient.<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup> It avoided a governmental hierarchy and lowered the cost of government to almost nothing, yet it provided a minimum of state-like, executive branch services. Once private enforcement was established, the rights to vengeance-taking were often sold by family members to advocates, who sometimes were aspiring farmers but for the most part were chieftains. Through the office of chieftaincy, a seat in the national legislature, the lögrétta, was marketable personal property. Nevertheless, acquisition was only the entry price: a leader needed personal abilities to succeed as the head of a following of thingmen. Farmers in conflict who were unable to enforce their claims turned to advocates, especially goðar, who had the support of a group and enjoyed superior opportunities to manipulate the legal system. For their support of farmers and other chieftains in lawsuits and feuds, goðar expected to be paid, even though transferable wealth was in limited supply in Iceland.
> 
> The marketable nature of the goðorð had a profound effect. The availability of this relatively low-level yet paramount position of authority contributed significantly to the stability of the Free State in the early centuries. As class distinctions did not constitute formal barriers to acquiring the office of chieftaincy, an ambitious, successful farmer could set his sights on becoming a goði. Reward could be sought within Iceland’s social and political systems rather than in changing them. Until the appearance of overlords in the thirteenth century (discussed in Chapter 19), there is no evidence that Iceland’s peasantry was disgruntled.


<a id="org1f6e8ac"></a>

#### A Proto-democratic Community?

(Is this why it failed?)

> Despite the deference accorded to successful goðar, the society’s egalitarian ethos was so strong that the goðar participated in governmental processes that were often proto-democratic.
> 
> For the chieftains, permanent coercive power remained unobtainable until the very end of the Free State. Even then, in the thirteenth century, they were unable to translate their power into operable state structures. Repeatedly during the history of the Free State the rights of free farmers tempered the demands of the goðar. Throughout this study I explain the prerogatives enjoyed by the baendr<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16" role="doc-backlink">16</a></sup> and the strategies by which they defended their rights. Here too there are hints of early democratic development as well as signs of a self- limiting pattern of state formation.

DTGTF:

> Imagine a world government, democratically elected according to the principle of one-man-one-vote on a worldwide scale. What would the probable outcome of an election be? Most likely, we would get a Chinese-Indian coalition government. And what would this government most likely decide to do in order to satisfy its supporters and be reelected? The government would probably find that the so-called Western world had far too much wealth and the rest of the world, in particular China and India, far too little, and that a systematic wealth and income redistribution would be necessary.
> 
> Or imagine that in your own country the right to vote were expanded to seven year olds. While the government would not likely be staffed of children, its policies would most definitely reflect the &ldquo;legitimate concerns&rdquo; of children to have &ldquo;adequate and &rdquo;equal&ldquo; access to &rdquo;free&ldquo; french fries, lemonade, and videos. With these &rdquo;thought experiments&ldquo; in mind, there can be no doubt about the consequences which resulted from the process of democratization that began in Europe and the U.S. in the second half of the nineteenth century and has come to fruition since the end of World War I. The successive expansion of the franchise and finally the establishment of universal adult suffrage did *within* each country what a world democracy would do for the entire globe: it set in motion a seemingly permanent tendency toward wealth and income redistribution.
> 
> One-man-one-vote combined with &ldquo;free entry&rdquo; into government democracy implies that every person and his personal property comes within reach of and is up for grabs by everyone else. A &ldquo;tragedy of the commons&rdquo; is created. It can be expected that majorities of &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; will relentlessly try to enrich themselves at the expense of minorities of &ldquo;haves.&rdquo; This is not to say that there will be only one class of have-nots and one class of haves, and that the redistribution will occur uniformly from the rich onto the poor. To the contrary. While the redistribution from rich to poor will always play a prominent role, it would be a sociological blunder to assume that it will be the sole or even the predominant form of redistribution. After all, the &ldquo;permanently&rdquo; rich and the &ldquo;permanently&rdquo; poor are usually rich or poor for a reason. The rich are characteristically bright and industrious, and the poor typically dull, lazy, or both. It is not very likely that dullards, even if they make up a majority, will systematically outsmart and enrich themselves at the expense of a minority of bright and energetic individuals. Rather, most redistribution will take place within the group of the &ldquo;non-poor,&rdquo; and frequently it will actually be the better-off who succeed in having themselves subsidized by the worse-off. Consider, for example, the almost universal practice of offering a &ldquo;free&rdquo; university education, whereby the working class, whose children rarely attend universities, pay through taxation for the education of middle-class children! Moreover, it can be expected that there will be many competing groups and coalitions trying to gain at the expense of others. There will be various changing criteria defining what it is that makes one person a &ldquo;have&rdquo; (deserving to be looted) and another a &ldquo;have-not&rdquo; (deserving to receive the loot). At the same time, individuals will be members of a multitude of groups of &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;have-nots,&rdquo; losing on account of one of their characteristics and gaining on account of another, with some individuals ending up net-losers and others net-winners of redistribution.


<a id="orgaa3a8e8"></a>

#### Icelandic Feud: Conflict Management

(could this saga make for a good story-telling backdrop?)

> As an effective way to diminish the damages of feuding, a revised form of conflict management evolved. Feud in Iceland was more a public than a private matter. As such it was discussed at the assemblies and directed to the law courts. This public trajectory assisted peacemaking regardless of whether arbitrations and settlements were made in or out of court. Iceland’s overseas Norse community was culturally split between the military values of the mother country and the more peaceful realities of the new land. When involved in disputes, Icelanders postured in the manner of Viking Age warriors, yet the threatening and the posturing described in the sagas led only to mild battles. ‘Warfare’, to use the anthropological term for small-scale feuding and socially structured violence, occurred mostly at the individual or the family level. Even when several hundred farmers assembled, there were very few deaths. As seen from the sometimes exaggerated crisis situations in the sagas, small groups might be sufficiently motivated to kill a few of their opponents, but larger groups found solutions, avoiding large-scale fighting. As a society Icelanders consistently acted with restraint. They learned to ritualize and even to limit the use of force. Only at the very end of the Free State did the endemic feuding reach the level of open warfare, and even then random violence was sporadic.
> 
> *The Saga of Thorgils and Haflidi (Thorgils saga ok Hafliða)* recounts an episode of feud, restraint and compromise. Two powerful chieftains were at loggerheads, and a mediator, a man with clerical ambitions, intervened. Set in the early twelfth century, the saga, which is found in the Sturlunga compilation, tells the story of two powerful chieftains, Thorgils Oddason and Haflidi Masson. Other men frequently tried to arbitrate the dispute between these godar. Both leaders went to the Althing of 1121, Haflidi with 1,440 men and Thorgils with 940. Earlier, when the two men had discussed a settlement at the Althing, Thorgils, defying attempts to reach a settlement, had viciously attacked and maimed Haflidi.
> 
> The situation was unusually dangerous because Haflidi, having been betrayed, was intransigent. Seeking vengeance, he steadfastly refused to engage in reasonable negotiations. Normally third parties would have intervened to arbitrate a compromise solution, but the two weeks of the Althing slipped by without intervention by ‘men of good will’ {góðviljamenn), and a major clash became more likely. At this juncture (Chapter 28) Ketil Thorsteinsson, who was not involved in the feud, comes forward. He tells Haflidi about an experience of his own which concerned issues of honour, prestige and the call for blood-taking:
> 
> ‘It seems a great pity to your friends if a settlement is not reached and this case is not brought to a good end. Yet many think it is hopeless now, or nearly so. I know of no advice to give you, but I have a parable to tell you.
> 
> ‘We grew up in Eyjafjord, and it was said that we were promising. I made what was thought to be the best possible match - with Groa, the daughter of Bishop Gizur. But it was said that she was unfaithful to me.
> 
> ‘I thought it hard that there was such talk. Trials were held and they went well. But nevertheless the persistent tales were offensive to me, and for this reason I grew very hostile toward the other man [his wife’s seducer]. One time when we met each other in passing, I attacked him. But he ducked under the blow and I found myself under him. Then he drew his knife and stabbed me in the eye so that I lost my sight in that eye. Then he, Gudmund Grimsson, let me get up, and it seemed to me there was something wrong about this. I had twice his strength, and so I thought we would compare similarly in other things.
> 
> ‘I fiercely wanted to avenge his wounding me with the strength of my kinsmen and to have him outlawed. We prepared our case. But some powerful men offered to support him, and therefore my suit came to nothing. It may now also happen that men come forward to support Thorgils, even though your case is more just.
> 
> ‘When my case had reached this point, they [Gudmund’s party] offered to pay a fine in settlement. I thought about what I had had to endure and how heavily it had all weighed on me, and I refused the offer&#x2026; And I found, when thinking about my honour, that no offers could have been paid which would have sated my honour.’
> 
> Ketil, helped by his religious nature (with Haflidi’s backing, he later became a bishop), came to realize that his demand for absolute justice was not reasonable and settled the dispute. The point of Ketil’s tale is well made, for shortly thereafter Haflidi submits his case to reasonable arbitration, and a settlement is arranged which both men then honour. This adherence to rules, which made it honourable to address order more than justice, was inherited from Scandinavian legal tradition and underlies Njal’s famous statement in his saga, when feuding parties would no longer play by the rules: ‘Our land must be built with law or laid waste with lawlessness.’

## Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case, <http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html>

> Iceland is known to men as a land of volcanoes, geysers and glaciers. But it ought to be no less interesting to the student of history as the birthplace of a brilliant literature in poetry and prose, and as the home of a people who have maintained for many centuries a high level of intellectual cultivation. It is an almost unique instance of a community whose culture and creative power flourished independently of any favouring material conditions. and indeed under conditions in the highest degree unfavourable. Nor ought it to be less interesting to the student of politics and laws as having produced a Constitution unlike any other whereof records remain and a body of law so elaborate and complex, that it is hard to believe that it existed among men whose chief occupation was to kill one another.

&#x2014; James Bryce, Studies in History and Jurisprudence 263 (1901)

> Legal conflicts were of great interest to the medieval Icelanders: Njal, the eponymous hero of the most famous of the sagas, is not a warrior but a lawyer&#x2013;&ldquo;so skilled in law that no one was considered his equal.&rdquo; In the action of the sagas, law cases play as central a role as battles.

> The idea that law is primarily private, that most offenses are offenses against specific individuals or families, and that punishment of the crime is primarily the business of the injured party seems to be common to many early systems of law and has been discussed at some length by Maine with special reference to the early history of Roman law.
> 
> Medieval Iceland, however, presents institutions of private enforcement of law in a purer form than any other well-recorded society of which I am aware. Even early Roman law recognized the existence of crimes, offenses against society rather than against any individual, and dealt with them, in effect, by using the legislature as a special court. Under Anglo-Saxon law killing was an offense against the victim&rsquo;s family, his lord, and the lord of the place whose peace had been broken; wergeld was paid to the family, manbote to the crown, and fightwite to the respective lords. British thief-takers in the eighteenth century were motivated by a public reward of sterling 40 per thief. All of these systems involved some combination of private and public enforcement. The Icelandic system developed without any central authority comparable to the Anglo-Saxon king; as a result, even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially &ldquo;public&rdquo; offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system.

> In the structure of its legislature, Iceland again presents an almost pure form of an institution, elements of which exist elsewhere. British pocket boroughs, like Icelandic godord;, represented marketable seats in the legislature, but Parliament did not consist entirely of representatives from pocket boroughs. All godord were marketable and (with the exception, after Iceland&rsquo;s conversion to Christianity, of the two Icelandic bishops) all seats in the lögrétta were held by the owners of godord, or men chosen by them.

> The political system which they developed there was based on Norwegian (or possibly Danish) traditions but with one important innovation&#x2013;the King was replaced by an assembly of local chieftains. As in Norway (before Harald) there was nothing corresponding to a strictly feudal bond. The relationship between the Icelandic godi and his thingmen (thingmenn) was contractual, as in early feudal relationships, but it was not territorial; the godi had no claim to the thingman&rsquo;s land and the thingman was free to transfer his allegiance.

> At the base of the system stood the godi (pl. godar) and the godord (pl. godord). A godi was a local chief who built a (pagan) temple and served as its priest; the godord was the congregation. The godi received temple dues and provided in exchange both religious and political services.
> 
> Under the system of laws established in A.D. 930 and modified somewhat thereafter, these local leaders were combined into a national system. Iceland was divided into four quarters, and each quarter into nine godord.[23] Within each quarter the godord were clustered in groups of three called things. Only the godar owning these godord had any special status within the legal system&#x2026;
> 
> The one permanent official of this system was the logsogumadr or law- speaker; he was elected every three years by the inhabitants of one quarter (which quarter it was being chosen by lot). His job was to memorize the laws, to recite them through once during his term in office, to provide advice on difficult legal points, and to preside over the lögrétta, the &ldquo;legislature.&rdquo;
> 
> The members of the lögrétta were the godar, plus one additional man from each thing, plus for each of these two advisors. Decisions in the lögrétta were made, at least after the reforms attributed to Njal, by majority vote, subject apparently to attempts to first achieve unanimity.

> I have described the legislative and judicial branches of &ldquo;government&rdquo; but have omitted the executive. So did the Icelanders. The function of the courts was to deliver verdicts on cases brought to them. That done, the court was finished. If the verdict went against the defendant, it was up to him to pay the assigned punishment&#x2013;almost always a fine. If he did not, the plaintiff could go to court again and have the defendant declared an outlaw. The killer of an outlaw could not himself be prosecuted for the act; in addition, anyone who gave shelter to an outlaw could be prosecuted for doing so.

## Medieval Iceland and the Absence of Government, <https://mises.org/library/medieval-iceland-and-absence-government>

[I think this article slightly over-states just how stateless Iceland was]

> The main reason the Vikings moved from Norway to Iceland in the first place was to avoid the feudal relationship between the king and his lords and serfs and thus the Icelandic settlers developed a decentralized system of governance.

> There was no public property during the era of the Vikings in Iceland, all property was privately owned.

[citation needed]

> Jesse Byock states in his book that, &ldquo;leadership evolved in such a way that a chieftain&rsquo;s power and the resources available to him were not derived from an exploitable realm.&rdquo; This was because free farmers could change allegiance between godi without moving to a new geographical location. &ldquo;The legal godi-thingman bond was created by a voluntary public contract.&rdquo;3  The ability to switch legal systems with out moving, is key to a decentralized system. It creates secession down the level of the individual, making all governance structures formed truly voluntary.

> Even in times of war, it was understood that every man that was killed had to be paid for.5 This kept feuds short, there were never any real wars, and the violence could be classified as either a family feud or a battle. Battles were short and lasted a couple of days at most.6  Both parties always had the incentive to compromise and make amends because sustained violence is costly in this type of institutional framework.

> When one truly looks at Iceland&rsquo;s history objectively, one can see what the real causes of Iceland&rsquo;s collapse was. The lack of competition and the monopolistic qualities that eventually came about when five families cornered the chieftaincy market was one reason. These five families bought the majority of chieftaincies. They controlled the court and legal system to a significant extent. This meant that there were not as many chieftains to choose from. This led to less competition, creating opportunities for increased exploitation over the free farmers, eventually leading to a revolt against the 5 families.
> 
> Roderick Long also addresses the fact that the introduction of the tithe in 1096 may have aided in the collapse of Iceland. The tithe was a tax paid for the upkeep of the Catholic Church and to pay church officials. The only stipulation was that the money appropriated to the upkeep of the church went to the private landowner (usually a chieftain). It is also no surprise that the chieftains were exempt from paying this property tax. Chieftains had expropriated earnings from free farmers and the free farmers had no way to keep the chieftains in check.

## Privatization, Viking Style: Model or Misfortune?, <https://www.lewrockwell.com/2002/06/roderick-t-long/the-vikings-were-libertarians/>

> &ldquo;Medieval Iceland had no bureaucrats, no taxes, no police, and no army. … Of the normal functions of governments elsewhere, some did not exist in Iceland, and others were privatized, including fire-fighting, criminal prosecutions and executions, and care of the poor.&rdquo;

Citing Diamond, J. &ldquo;[Living on the Moon](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15414)&rdquo;

> Lying in the North Atlantic between Norway and Greenland, its northern shores brushing the Arctic Circle, Iceland is a stark and desolate landscape of basalt and frozen lava, punctuated by volcanoes, geysers, and glaciers – eerily beautiful for tourists, though a wearying challenge for farmers. Such a harsh natural environment might have attracted few immigrants, were it not for a still harsher political climate back on the mainland. Iceland&rsquo;s first settlers – Norse and Celto-Norse refugees from King Harald Fairhair&rsquo;s attempt in the late ninth century to impose centralized control and property taxes on all of Norway – established what historians call the Icelandic Free State, or Icelandic Commonwealth, around the year 930. In Diamond&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;they privatized government beyond Ronald Reagan’s wildest dreams&rdquo; (since Reagan dramatically increased the size and expense of government over the course of his administration, this is quite an understatement), &ldquo;and thereby collapsed in a civil war that cost them their independence.&rdquo;
> 
> This &ldquo;thereby&rdquo; is somewhat misleading, however, since civil strife did not become a serious problem in Iceland until around 1220, nearly three centuries after the system was established – and the system&rsquo;s final collapse did not come until 42 years after that. As I have written [elsewhere](http://www.libertariannation.org/a/f13l1.html): &ldquo;We should be cautious in labeling as a failure a political experiment that flourished longer than the United States has even existed.&rdquo; Indeed, given Diamond&rsquo;s criterion of instability, the United States cannot be called stable until it survives the year 2108. (Though one could argue that it has already failed the test: the United States had to wait only 85 years from its founding before plunging into a catastrophic civil war, by contrast with Iceland&rsquo;s 290 years.)

> How did the Icelandic Free State work? The 11th-century historian Adam von Bremen described Iceland as having &ldquo;no king but the law.&rdquo; The legal system&rsquo;s administration, insofar as it had one, lay in the hands of a parliament of about 40 officers whom historians call, however inadequately, &ldquo;chieftains.&rdquo; This parliament had no budget and no employees; it met only two weeks per year. In addition to their parliamentary role, chieftains were empowered in their own local districts to appoint judges and to keep the peace; this latter job was handled on an essentially fee-for-service basis. The enforcement of judicial decisions was largely a matter of self-help (hence Iceland&rsquo;s reputation as a land of constant private feuding), but those who lacked the might to enforce their rights could sell their court-decreed claims for compensation to someone more powerful, usually a chieftain; hence even the poor and friendless could not be victimized with impunity.
> 
> The basis of a chieftain&rsquo;s power within the political order was the power he already possessed outside it, in civil society. The office of chieftaincy was private property, and could be bought or sold; hence chieftaincies tended to track private wealth. But wealth alone was not enough. As economic historian Birgir Solvason notes in his [masterful study](http://www.hi.is/~bthru/contents.html) of the period, &ldquo;just buying the chieftainship was no guarantee of power&rdquo;; the mere office by itself was &ldquo;almost worthless&rdquo; unless the chieftain could &ldquo;convince some free-farmers to follow him.&rdquo; Chieftains did not hold authority over territorially-defined districts, but competed for clients with other chieftains from the same geographical area.

> A chieftain was politician, lawyer, and policeman rolled into one: he represented his clients in parliament, served as their advocate in arbitration, and offered them armed assistance in dispute resolution. If his customers were dissatisfied with the quality or price of these services, they could switch to a different chieftain without having to change their physical location; the relation between chieftain and client could be freely terminated by either party, so that signing up with a chieftain was rather like signing up for insurance or long-distance phone service today; legal jurisdictions were, in effect, &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; rather than physical.
> 
> The fact that the provision of &ldquo;governmental&rdquo; services was a competitive rather than a monopolistic enterprise was arguably one of the Free State&rsquo;s greatest strengths; just as in any other market, the competitive discipline imposed by the fear of losing clients to rival service providers served as a check on inefficiency and abuse of power. Icelandic law owed its resilience and flexibility to this decoupling of authority from geography.

> &#x2026;the &ldquo;lack of geographically defined chieftaincies&rdquo; meant that no group could claim &ldquo;exclusive or long-time control over any one area&rdquo;; as a result, there were &ldquo;few territorial &lsquo;refuge areas&rsquo;&rdquo; where &ldquo;feuding parties lived protected … by a cluster of kin and friends.&rdquo; This &ldquo;made sustained feuding difficult,&rdquo; creating increased incentives for compromise. In other words, the non-territorial nature of Iceland&rsquo;s legal order served to decrease, not to increase, the violence of feud.

> Reading the Icelandic Sagas initially gives the impression of unremitting violence – until one notices that most of the feuds they describe consist of low-casualty skirmishes at long intervals. Though often referred to as &ldquo;Vikings,&rdquo; Icelanders made their living for the most part through farming and trade, and violence was sporadic; thanks to the economic incentives provided by Iceland&rsquo;s legal system, conflicts were settled in court more often than in combat. Like any good storyteller, the authors of the Sagas simply skipped over the long boring periods when nobody was killing anybody.

> To keep Icelandic feud in perspective, one may contrast it with continental Europe, whose princes, blessed with &ldquo;mutually exclusive territories,&rdquo; launched massive wars. As Solvason points out, Icelandic society was &ldquo;more peaceful and cooperative than its contemporaries&rdquo;; in England and Norway, by contrast, &ldquo;the period from about 800 to 1200 is a period of continuous struggle; high in both violence and killings.&rdquo; Byock contrasts the prolonged and violent civil strife which attended Christianization in Norway with its relatively swift and peaceful Icelandic analogue. Icelanders treated the conflict between pagans and Christians as a feud, to be resolved like any other feud – by arbitration. The arbitrator decided in favor of Christianity, and that was that. (So imbued were the Icelanders with the norms of conflict resolution through arbitration that they dealt with haunted houses in the same way – trying the ghosts for trespassing, in the confident expectation that, if found guilty, a good Icelandic ghost would respect the verdict of the court and peacefully depart!) Even at the Free State&rsquo;s worst, during the system&rsquo;s catastrophic breakdown into intestine warfare in the 1200s, the body count was fairly low; as Friedman writes:
> 
> &ldquo;During more than fifty years of what the Icelanders themselves perceived as intolerably violent civil war, leading to the collapse of the traditional system, the average number of people killed or executed each year appears, on a per capita basis, to be roughly equal to the current rate of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter in the United States.&rdquo;
> 
> Obviously the level of violence during the three centuries before the civil war must have been even lower.

> But if the Icelandic Free State was so successful, why did it eventually collapse? Clearly, the explanation lies in the growing centralization of wealth and power. As Diamond writes:
> 
> &ldquo;Originally, soon after settlement, Iceland had about 4,500 independent farms, but by the thirteenth century 80 percent of Iceland&rsquo;s farmland was owned by five families, and all the other formerly independent farmers had become tenants.&rdquo;
> 
> These five families also managed to buy up most of the chieftaincies, enabling them to dominate the courts and parliament. The concentration of chieftaincies in fewer hands also meant an end to the existence of competing chieftains within the same territory; Iceland began to be fractured into regions, each operating as a local monopoly or mini-state. During the years 1220-1262, the resulting struggle for hegemony among these mini-states broke out into open conflict, a crisis that was finally resolved only when the Icelanders, exhausted by civil war, invited King Haakon of Norway to govern them, thus bringing the Free State period to a close.
> 
> To Diamond, this final decision illustrates the utter bankruptcy of the Icelandic system: &ldquo;I cannot think of another historical case of an independent country that became so desperate that it turned itself over to another country.&rdquo; Perhaps he should have tried harder; he might have remembered England in 1688, offering the crown to William of Orange after deposing the Stuarts – or, harking farther back, the many small states who responded to civil strife by calling in a Roman garrison, thus submitting de facto to Roman authority. Moreover, the very desperation of the move indicates how unaccustomed the Icelanders were to levels of violence that had long been commonplace on the mainland. In any case, the Icelanders presumably saw the Covenant of 1262-64, not as a surrender of national independence, but simply as yet another case of signing up with a new chieftain because their previous chieftains had proven unsatisfactory. This new chieftain, the Norwegian king, was farther away, and so perhaps less dangerous; certainly he was wealthier than any Icelandic chieftain, and so (they imagined) less tax-hungry. What they failed to recognize was the incentive implications of switching from a competitive system to a monopolistic one – though admittedly, their own system had lost much of its competitive character already. (War is not a form of competition; it is what arises when competition breaks down.)

> A more plausible explanation for the Free State&rsquo;s decline points to the introduction of the tithe in 1096. Made possible by Iceland&rsquo;s conversion to Christianity a century earlier, the tithe – to pay church officials and maintain church buildings – was Iceland&rsquo;s first real tax. (Previous &ldquo;taxes&rdquo; generally turn out on closer inspection to be voluntary exchanges of fees for services.) Assessed at 1% of the payer&rsquo;s property, it was also Iceland&rsquo;s first graduated tax (earlier fees were one-size-fits-all), and so took in much more revenue. Most importantly, the tithe lacked a competitive element. Recall the non-territorial character of a chieftain&rsquo;s jurisdiction: a chieftain&rsquo;s temptations to self-aggrandizement were kept in check by the knowledge that if he acquired delusions of grandeur or charged too high a price for his services, his clients could abandon him for a rival. But the tithe was territorial; all those who lived in the vicinity of a particular church building had to pay for its upkeep, and were not at liberty to transfer their support elsewhere. The catch is that the portion of tithe revenue allocated to maintaining church buildings went not to the official church hierarchy but to the wealthy private owners (usually chieftains) of staðir, &ldquo;churchsteads,&rdquo; i.e., plots of land on which churches had been built. The tithe was a property tax; but chieftaincies, though marketable commodities, were exempt – as were the churchsteads themselves, predominantly owned by chieftains. (The parliament that enacted the tithe law was of course composed entirely of chieftains.)
> 
> The tithe thus did more than just increase the income of the chieftains; it decoupled that income from accountability. Economic inequalities per se are not a serious threat to liberty so long as they operate in a genuine market context, where the way to gain and maintain wealth is to please one&rsquo;s customers; before the introduction of the tithe, a chieftain who proved too power-hungry would alienate his customers and so suffer financial discipline. But chieftains who owned churchsteads now had a captive market, and so were freed from all competitive restraints on their accumulation of wealth and power. Through buying off or intimidating less wealthy chieftains, the top families were able to gain control of multiple chieftaincies. This gave them a lock on the parliament, enabling them to pass still further taxes; it also decreased competition among chieftains, allowing them to charge monopoly prices and drive their clients into a serf-like state of debt and dependence.
> 
> The Icelandic system did fall through an inherent flaw, then, but not the one Diamond imagines; the Free State failed, not through having too much privatization, but through having too little. The tithe, and particularly the portion allotted to churchstead maintenance, represented a monopolistic, non-competitive element in the system. The introduction of the tithe was in turn made possible by yet another non-competitive element: the establishment of an official state church which everyone was legally bound to support. Finally, buying up chieftaincies would have availed little if there had been free entry into the chieftaincy profession; instead, the number of chieftains was set by law, and the creation of new chieftaincies could be approved only by parliament – i.e., by the existing chieftains, who were naturally less than eager to encourage competitors. It is precisely those respects in which the Free State was least privatized and decentralized that led to its downfall – while its more privatized aspects delayed that downfall for three centuries.

## Ordered Anarchy, State and Rent-Seeking: The Icelandic Commonwealth, 930&#x2013;1264, <https://notendur.hi.is/bthru/contents.html>


<a id="org277bf94"></a>

### Abstract

> By the last decade of the eleventh century the chieftains were able to use their position to introduce the tithe, obligating farmers to pay a tax to the chieftains and the Church, of one percentile of their wealth. In essence, rent-seeking (defection) became more profitable for the chieftains than long-term reciprocical behaviour. Reciprocity, fruitful in establishing Iceland&rsquo;s institutional structure, lost its importance and such behaviour diminished. The tied sales of legal and religious services established the chieftains as local monopolies, as minimal states. These minimal states now competed for more territory, and population, and, most importantly, more chieftaincies and churches. The minimal states became fewer and fewer as the surviving ones triumphed in their advancements. Through the struggle for wealth and power the chieftains mostly killed each other and by 1250 only a few chiefdoms and even fewer chieftains survived. By that time the king of Norway had established a foothold in the country and by the voluntary choice of the Icelandic farmers in 1262-64, was accepted as king of Iceland.

### The Emergence of Social Order in the Icelandic Commonwealth


<a id="org40c9142"></a>

#### The Emergence of Institutions

> The way a chieftain established a following supports the view that the chieftains were originally arbitrators. This can be seen in that each freeman-farmer could pick a chieftain to follow; the farmer chose his arbitrator. After the establishment of certain [number] of these chieftainships, their numbers became fixed by law. Each freeman-farmer could still pick a chieftain to follow, but his choices were now limited by the number of chieftains

&#x2014;He notes here that the exact origin of this structure is disputed


<a id="orge02a733"></a>

#### The Commune, or Hreppar

> But according to the lawbook, the Grágás, the Hreppur was composed of a minimum of twenty farms and had a five member commission. Among other things, the Hreppur was responsible for seeing that orphans and the poor within the area were fed and housed. It did this by assigning these persons to member farms, which took turns in providing for them. How long each farm had to provide for the person was determined by the wealth of the farm.
> 
> The Hreppur also served as a property insurance agency. It assisted in case of fire and losses due to diseased livestock. If, for example, a farm&rsquo;s kitchen burned down, the other farmers in the Hreppur would pitch in to build a new one. If both kitchen and living quarters burned, then half of each was paid for. In case of disease, if more than a quarter of the livestock died, the other farmers would provide assistance. There was, furthermore, a maximum amount each farmer had to contribute, and no farmer had to assist the same farm more than three times. The Hreppur had its rules and regulations. Among these was a rule that no one could move into the Hreppur unless he had the recommendation of another such unit. Finally, the Hreppur may have organized and controlled summer grazing lands in cooperation with the members.

> That these institutions would not span the whole country is similar to the &ldquo;large-number&rdquo; problem in Axelrod&rsquo;s theory. When a group contains a certain number of people, it becomes more beneficial for some group members to defect than cooperate. Thus, what developed early in Iceland was probably a number of each type of institution; many local Þings and many more Hreppar. The two types of institutions also fit well with the trust-rules vs. solidarity-rules distinction. The Þing emerged and functioned as a cluster for market activities, such as trade, and as an arbitrator for two-person dealings. These correspond to problems with trust-rules, and fit the prediction that these rules are essentially for market type orders. The Hreppur was as a cluster for common concerns, such as the need for private and social insurance. It corresponds to problems with solidarity-rules, and fulfils the more general prediction that such rules apply to organization type orders. It is also noteworthy that the Hreppur defines the relevant membership group before producing any benefits.

> These two institutions are also seem to have been overlapping in membership. The Hreppur was geographical in jurisdiction, while the Þing was not. Once a farm had joined a given Hreppur, its affiliation could not be changed. The farmer, on the other hand, could legally change his alliance to another chieftain, and therefore another Þing, once each year. These institutions also fit the large-number distinction that was made above, in that each Hreppur had fewer members than each local Þing.

#### Institutions of the Second Order

> It is clear from the sources that Vorþings arose, so no conjecture is needed here. These were local assemblies that gathered about 3 chieftains and their followers. It seems, from the sources and to an agreement among the historians, that at least two of these had arisen by 930, Kjalarnesþing and Þórsnesþing. These local þings, the Vorþings, acted both as assemblies of freemen and as local courts of law.

> Another institution, the Quarter-Þing, or Fjórðungsþing, was also established in this same time period, before 965. The Quarter-Þing was comprised of nine chieftains and their followers and, like the other Þings, served as a court. The dates of the formation of these are not known for certain, but references in the Sagas to Þings date the emergence of some forms of these lower level courts before 965.

> The next step in the development of the institutional structure was the formation of the general assembly, the Alþing. With this development the whole population of the country began to become united under one body of law, referred to as &ldquo;our law&rdquo; (vár lög). At the same time the court system was becoming more formalized. Procedural rules embodied in a constitution were being established. The functions of the Alþing were twofold. First, the Alþing served as a Law-Council. Second, the Alþing served as the highest court. To begin with the Law-Council likely acted as a court also but after 965 the court at the Alþing was divided into Fjórðungsdóma, or Quarter-Courts. These corresponded to the lower level Fjórðungsþings, but were seemingly established at the Alþing, and the former became abandoned. The Alþing formed around 930, and the structure established in the period 930-965 remained more or less the same until the fall of the Commonwealth. One change took place in the period 1004-1030; the Fimmtardómur, or the Fifth-Court, was added. This court became the final court, in some respects like a supreme court. It became responsible for unresolved cases and procedural cases, such as cases involving perjury or the bribing of jurors.

> Aside from this official structure, there was also private dispute resolution by individual chieftains, and sometimes a few chieftains would come together with their followers and resolve cases in Private-Þings. It therefore seems that the abandonment of the Quarter-Þings resulted in the formation of extra-legal institutions, although these were essentially continuations of previous institutions (Benediktsson 1974).

> The logic of the institutional emergence is as follows: on the one hand I have the postulated individual chieftain group, and on the other the Hreppur. On top of these the local assemblies and then the Quarter-Þings evolved. Finally, as the overlapping layer, we have the Alþing, interconnecting all groups.19 At the same time however, the Icelanders were beginning to restructure the boundaries between these groups to correspond to geographical boundaries, and this may have given rise to new conflicts. However, this restructuring also established clear procedural rules for handling cases and institutionalized the flow of information about legal matters and defections. Through this institution, known as the Leiðir, everyone should have been able to acquire knowledge necessary to distinguish between cooperators and defectors, and learn the law.

### From a Decentralised Order to Minimal States


<a id="org910bda3"></a>

#### A Decentralised Order

> &ldquo;The political arena of the early Commonwealth can be seen as a competitive market of thirty-nine firms of similar sizes. Each firm involved contracts between the chieftain and his liegemen for the joint production and protection of property rights. The power of a chieftain was constrained in various ways. He could not tax his followers like a feudal lord, and there was some flexibility: A farmer was free to cancel his contract with a chieftain and take up association with another.&rdquo; (Eggertsson 1990:308)


<a id="orgab20f97"></a>

### The Political Economy of Rent-Seeking and the End of the Commonwealth

> Bishop Gizur was loved more intensely by the whole population, than any other man, to our knowledge, has ever been in this country. As a result of his popularity, and his and Sæmundur&rsquo;s recommendations, and by the advice of Markús the lawspeaker, a law was passed that everyone should count and appraise his property; and swear that the evaluation was correct, whether land or chattels, and then pay tithes thereof. It shows the great power of the man that the people as a whole obeyed him; that he succeeded to complete the appraisal of all real and personal property in Iceland under oath, and collected tithes thereof. A law was also passed which made this compulsory as long as Iceland was inhabited.
