+ slavery
  + nobody likes it
  + planation economy had masters that treated slaves nicely
  + slaves were allowed to live family lives
  + problem is the institution
  + idea that a person should be owned is intolerable whether the owner is nice or not
  + same is true for people who are rented
  + its just as much of an infringement
  + the question is whether decisions over production, distribution etc should rest in the hands of the public
  + go to origins of classical liberal / democratic thought --- the leading principle is that human beings are born to inquire and create under their own initiative, any work done due to outside pressure is inhuman
  + if a person creates something beautiful under outside orders, we admire what he did but dispise what he is
  + human rights are infringed by business operations
