#+TITLE: Everyone is WRONG About Kim Potter | Why Kim Potter Should Be Put To Death | Death Penalty for Kim Potter | A Libertarian Analysis of Kim Potter

* Notes
** Nate The Lawyer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UDCTx455Gc
+ giving reasons for why kim potter shouldnt be convicted of manslaughter
+ facts:
  + officers pulled over car with two people inside
  + pulled over because there was an air-freshener on the rear view mirror
  + saw that the car was in a left turn only lane but had a right turn signal on
  + found that the car had expired tags
  + Daunte had no license or insurance and an order of protection against him and an arrest warrant
    + gross misdemeanor warrant for possession of a handgun without a permit, followed by running from police[fn:1][fn:2]
  + Daunte resisted arrest and tried to drive off, dragging some officers a short distance.
  + kim grabbed gun instead of taser and shot Daunte once, fatally wounding him
+ "wowee look at how cool and nice kim is she a union rep she so loved she not used her gun in 26 years"
+ first time Potter attempted to deploy taser in line of duty
+ states argument is that kim acted so carelessly as to make her criminally negligent.
+ justified risk because it was a lawful arrest (this is false)
** Actual Justice Warrior
*** Video 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K7JiLyts9o
+ shot daunte by accident
+ comparisons of size and weight are ridiculous, PB&J analogy
+ ridiculous to say that this was a pre-meditated murder plot
+ not anything to do with race
+ narrative is 'he just had air fresheners'
+ robbed and choked a woman[fn:3]
+ kim did not shoot due to the above warrant, it was a mistake
+ wrong to say that Daunte didn't know about the warrant
+ comes down to police department policy, therefore there may be authority to shoot
*** Video 3[fn:4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHrGOICBYYU
+ pulled over for expired registration tags which is a legitimate reason to pull someone over
+ turn signal business
+ and had an air freshener
+ open warrant on robbery (WRONG) (same source)
+ not entertaining the idea that kimberly potter did something that was anything but accidental in this scenario
+ yada yada yada positivism
