NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.900
You probably do not consider
yourself to be an anarchist

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.146
—in fact almost everybody considers
anarchism to be an ideology

00:00:06.146 --> 00:00:07.557
which is completely insane.

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:09.129
You might have minor disagreements

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.350
here and there with other people,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.423
but anarchism is surely a whole
different level of wrongness.

00:00:13.423 --> 00:00:15.905
I'm here to tell you
that you have been misled.

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:17.380
There are a few
different reasons

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.120
why I think someone
might reject anarchism

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.853
and I will be addressing them all.

00:00:20.993 --> 00:00:23.763
On this first point,
a typical claim might go like:

00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:25.393
"in an anarchist society
there would be

00:00:25.393 --> 00:00:27.303
no centralized government
to enforce the law,

00:00:27.303 --> 00:00:28.861
so there would be total chaos."

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:30.677
The first error made
by the this sort of claim

00:00:30.677 --> 00:00:32.460
is that it is substituting the <i>result</i>

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.491
that the claimant expects
would come from anarchy

00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:36.719
for the <i>definition</i> of anarchy.

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:39.551
This is an inversion of
the correct order of operations:

00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.349
we need to first establish
what anarchism actually is

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:44.165
before we can determine what results

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:46.223
we expect to come about
from adhering to it.

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:48.864
Anarchism is a general term that
applies to any philosophy

00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:50.883
that rejects legal authoritarianism.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.236
Allow me to break that down;

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:55.875
legal authoritarianism is the thesis
that the law comes from some authority,

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:58.030
or in other words
that actions are justified

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.526
on the grounds that the preferred
authority says that they are.

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:03.374
As an example, say Robinson Crusoe
is on a desert island

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.199
and finds a stick poking out of a tree.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.907
He expects that this stick
would allow him to begin spearfishing,

00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:09.684
so he fashions a point onto the end

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:11.695
and then runs off to
the ocean to give it a go.

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:14.640
At this point another man,
Friday, sees the stick and thinks

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.240
that it would be great to stoke his fire;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.270
so he runs up to Crusoe and
attempts to wrestle it off of him.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.709
If these men were so inclined to attempt

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:23.266
to justify their respective conduct
pertaining to the stick,

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.174
let's think about what they might say.

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:26.991
Crusoe could argue that it is
his stick

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:28.200
because he found it first

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200
and was already using it before Friday came over

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.389
and tried to take it from him.

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:33.439
Friday then says that this is irrelevant

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.600
because he wants the stick

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.960
and so is justified in taking it from Crusoe.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.450
Or perhaps Friday appeals to
a village elder who said

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.480
that Friday is the stick-keeper for the whole island,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.889
and so that is why he's justified.

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.829
You can think of any number
of different authorities

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.269
that Friday might appeal to,

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:48.181
whether it be himself, the village elder

00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:51.280
or even some deity that bestowed this power unto him

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.793
—but the point is that Friday
is justifying his conduct

00:01:53.793 --> 00:01:56.339
by reference to the sayso of an authority.

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:58.759
This means that Friday is a legal authoritarian,

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.119
with Crusoe being the legal anarchist.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.680
It is worth noting on this point

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.958
that anarchism doesn't mean
that there are no laws,

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.176
Crusoe is not asserting that anything goes,

00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:08.650
rather he is asserting that

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.880
the law does not come from
some authority figure's arbitrary decrees,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.170
that it is objective,
that it is inherent in nature.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.601
Accordingly, anarchism is called a theory of natural law.

00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:21.905
Now, which man strikes you
as being the more peaceful individual?

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:23.297
Surely it is Crusoe.

00:02:23.297 --> 00:02:24.740
Crusoe is minding his business

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.570
and then Friday physically attacked him

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.639
and attempted to deprive him
of his means of bettering his own life.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.640
This is an important observation:

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.990
anarchism is peaceful,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.440
it is the non-anarchists
who bring about chaos.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.885
Anarchism as such does not provide
a positive case for what the law is;

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:41.629
all it says is that it is non-authoritarian.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.099
This does not give us much;

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.572
it is often entirely unclear which party
in any given conflict is appealing to authority,

00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:48.880
or if either of them are.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.680
Thus, we need to turn to a specific subset of anarchism,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.190
called anarcho-capitalism,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.669
for our positive case.

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.916
Anarcho-capitalism starts by recognizing
the fundamental problem that law tackles:

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:00.712
namely, scarcity.

00:03:00.712 --> 00:03:02.310
It is only because the stick is scarce

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.980
that Crusoe and Friday can
come into conflict over its use.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.210
This requires a specific understanding of the terminology

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.140
—to say that a given entity is scarce

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.477
is to say that men can come
into conflicts over its use,

00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:15.627
where a conflict is defined
as mutually exclusive actions.

00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:17.815
Crusoe cannot use a stick to spearfish

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:20.470
at the same time that
Friday uses it to stoke his fire

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.410
—one action excludes the other

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.715
i.e. they are mutually exclusive.

00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:27.709
Thus, anarcho-capitalism holds
the non-aggression principle

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.914
as the fundamental starting point
for all legal analysis

00:03:30.914 --> 00:03:33.473
—where aggression means
the initiation of conflict.

00:03:33.473 --> 00:03:35.000
So for the case of the stick,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.333
we no longer have to imagine

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.508
what sort of justification Friday might bring,

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:40.161
we can simply see that he is the one

00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:43.929
who has initiated the conflict,
and thus his action is not justified.

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:47.640
It will be shown later on why any claim
contrary to the non-aggression principle

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.260
must devolve into legal authoritarianism

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.500
and why legal authoritarianism is false.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.218
For now, I must address a critique

00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:56.409
of my semantics here
forwarded by TIK.

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.949
To be clear, TIK agrees with the ancaps on ethics,

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.271
at least as far as I can tell,

00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:02.439
he just disagrees with calling it anarchism:

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.560
Anarchy just means no state.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.576
It doesn't mean everything's on fire
or people are barbarians.

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:10.829
It just means no state.

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.931
The problem is that the dictionary definition
of what a state is

00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:17.794
does not mention coercion.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.985
The dictionaries vary but
the essential definition is that

00:04:21.985 --> 00:04:24.811
a state is a politically-organised community

00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:26.964
on a given piece of territory.

00:04:26.964 --> 00:04:28.320
And the idea goes like this:

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.639
when humans gather together
they form hierarchies.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.275
These hierarchies, when they
reach a certain size,

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.780
get classed as "public"

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.060
which is when they become states.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.630
when you have a large hierarchy of society

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.980
that is classed as a state.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.487
So, on this view

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.970
anarchism is an ideology
that is opposed to the state,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.600
where the state is any "public" hierarchy.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.469
TIK says here that the standard for
what is "public" as against "private" is size.

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.611
He elaborates on this in another video:

00:04:58.611 --> 00:05:06.398
“The family did not receive its laws from the city… Private law existed before the city.”

00:05:06.398 --> 00:05:10.542
These families were <i>private</i> families.

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:14.336
Privus meaning single or individual

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:16.810
meant–and still does

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.130
–a person or belonging to a small group of people

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.200
that was separate from public life.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.367
In a sense, small, independent, private estates

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:33.701
rather than large organizations.

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.860
It is on this front

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.102
that the entire problem

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:38.160
with TIKs rejection of anarchism
can be found,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.630
because the definition of public
as against private that he is using

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.440
is a package deal.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.989
“Package-dealing” is the fallacy of failing
to discriminate crucial differences.

00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:49.407
It consists in treating together as parts
of a single conceptual whole

00:05:49.407 --> 00:05:50.199
or "package,"

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.610
elements which differ essentially

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.360
in nature, truth-status, importance or value.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.479
On both the private and the public front,

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.570
TIK engages in package dealing.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.412
For him private means small and

00:06:00.412 --> 00:06:02.180
either individual or collective

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.330
(the family unit is just a small collective)

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.870
and public means large and collective.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.565
This is clear to see 33 minutes into
his video on public versus private

00:06:10.565 --> 00:06:11.199
when he classes

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.880
"big business" under the same term as

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.825
"central banks" and "State".

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:16.496
This is where the package comes from,

00:06:16.496 --> 00:06:18.340
the historical association has been

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.999
that the only way for a society
to become large-scale

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:22.890
and have any "big" groups within it

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.812
is for those groups to rule everyone else.

00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:27.280
So, if we have a society where each individual

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.899
lives peacefully with everyone else

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:30.950
and operates purely on production and trade,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.377
is each person a state?

00:06:32.377 --> 00:06:33.710
I'm tempted to say they are

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.319
if there can be multiple "states"

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.260
in ancapistan like TIK says,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.110
but all of these interactions are individual,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.200
i.e. private, i.e. non-state.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.604
So then perhaps the “state” here
encompasses the entire private society,

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.030
but then we are back to the assumption

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.790
that the only way for there to be a society

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.906
is for them to be subjects who are
ruled under the same central authority.

00:06:50.906 --> 00:06:52.227
This is a problem.

00:06:52.227 --> 00:06:55.440
TIK justified his classing of
big business as "public" here

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.720
using the Rothbardian argument
against natural monopolisation.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.113
The argument is basically that

00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:02.686
as a firm grows in size
within some particular market

00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:04.732
it has a growing internal economy

00:07:04.732 --> 00:07:06.795
that it cannot perform calculation within.

00:07:06.795 --> 00:07:08.411
If you want to understand this point fully

00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:11.408
I suggest you watch this video
on the economic calculation problem

00:07:11.408 --> 00:07:13.949
—but I do not think
understanding that is required here.

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:15.960
This argument is correct as far as it goes,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.196
but it does not go as far as TIK needs it to go.

00:07:18.196 --> 00:07:21.391
The Rothbardian argument establishes
only that it is impossible

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:22.900
for a purely voluntary firm

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.199
to establish a strangle hold
over an entire market

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.855
and achieve natural monopolisation.

00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:29.100
It does not establish that no business

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.493
can ever become very large

00:07:30.493 --> 00:07:32.241
either in real or relative terms.

00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:34.647
In real terms, it is obviously possible for a firm

00:07:34.647 --> 00:07:37.950
in a society with a high level
of capital development

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.440
to be "big" in comparison

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.720
to Crusoe on the island;

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.300
and it is also possible for a firm
to come to some brand new

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.759
and very valuable innovation

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.149
that rockets them to the top

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:47.459
of an entirely new market for some period of time.

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:49.210
Thus "bigness" versus "smallness"

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.765
is not the key criterion we must work upon here.

00:07:51.765 --> 00:07:54.906
The correct criterion is collective
as against individual.

00:07:54.906 --> 00:07:56.347
The actual public entities

00:07:56.347 --> 00:07:57.933
such as the state or central banks

00:07:57.933 --> 00:07:59.599
operate through aggressive means,

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:01.503
they do not function on the trader's principle

00:08:01.503 --> 00:08:03.718
—rather they rely on being economic parasites

00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:06.189
sucking the blood of the productive men in society.

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:07.959
Those productive men may or may not

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.389
control vast wealth,

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.020
because the wealth or the bigness

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.500
is not the key component.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.488
Notice how this applies also
on the "private" side of TIKs definitions;

00:08:16.488 --> 00:08:18.426
he tells us that "private" means belonging to

00:08:18.426 --> 00:08:21.999
or for the use of one particular person
or <b>group of people</b> only.

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:23.368
The inclusion of the group here

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:25.741
is the infection of the term with collectivism.

00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:26.818
Thus the choice we are given

00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:29.160
is not between individualism or collectivism,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.317
it is between small-or big-collectivism.

00:08:31.317 --> 00:08:33.620
Group ownership is not possible,

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.719
it is a contradiction in terms.

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:36.440
The idea of group ownership comes about

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.884
out of pure Platonism

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:40.245
—the idea that the collective is the really real thing,

00:08:40.245 --> 00:08:42.237
and that the individual is merely a subsidiary

00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:44.360
or cell of the collective body.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.750
<i>That</i> is the proper division between public or private

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.679
—not whether things should be big or small,

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:49.900
but whether the political unit

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.080
and standard of value is

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.350
the one or the many,

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.788
the individual or the group,

00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:56.109
Howard Roark or Henry Cameron’s Egregore.

00:08:56.109 --> 00:08:57.880
The key insight to be gleaned here

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.180
is that definitions are not

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.904
and cannot be arbitrary labels
for whatever you want

00:09:01.904 --> 00:09:03.156
—the words that one uses

00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:06.276
must conform to the requirements
of man's conceptual faculty.

00:09:06.276 --> 00:09:09.745
It is the science of epistemology
that teaches us said requirements.

00:09:09.745 --> 00:09:11.314
The primary purpose of language

00:09:11.314 --> 00:09:12.980
is to objectify concepts,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.390
these concepts are formed by abstracting away

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.800
from concrete data which actually exists.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.270
Thus the concept itself isn't out there in the world

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.269
ready to be seen and recalled
at a moment's notice,

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:24.208
but by using a symbol to stand in its place

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:26.109
you make it perceptually graspable.

00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:28.200
Any definition that relies on a package deal

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.626
is thus an anathema to

00:09:29.626 --> 00:09:31.877
the very purpose of language in the first place:

00:09:31.877 --> 00:09:34.199
instead of aiding man's conceptual faculty,

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.380
it hinders it.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.466
Package deals are not valid concepts,

00:09:37.466 --> 00:09:38.894
and cannot be knowledge.

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:42.880
Any analysis that relies upon them
must therefore be entirely discarded.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.210
Anarchy accordingly does not mean
the absence of agression

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.000
<i>and</i> the absence of bigness,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.324
these are separate concepts

00:09:49.324 --> 00:09:51.157
that must be analyzed separately.

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:53.296
The absence of bigness is already captured

00:09:53.296 --> 00:09:55.375
by the concept of non-society.

00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:57.900
it is when you don't have a society

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.600
that you just have lone individuals

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.776
wandering out and not interacting with others.

00:10:00.776 --> 00:10:03.108
Thus the proper way to understand anarchy

00:10:03.108 --> 00:10:04.732
is to throw out the bigness aspect

00:10:04.732 --> 00:10:07.700
and have anarchy be the absence of aggression.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.925
Certainly, if you have no interactions

00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:10.290
between anyone ever,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.869
i.e. non-society,

00:10:11.869 --> 00:10:13.900
then you will have an absence of aggression.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.260
But the alternative to this

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.336
is not aggression + society.

00:10:17.336 --> 00:10:18.630
You can have a society

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.959
without aggression.

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:22.202
The theory of concepts that TIK is counting on

00:10:22.202 --> 00:10:24.784
in his use of historical definitions above all else,

00:10:24.784 --> 00:10:25.879
is called nominalism.

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:29.461
Nominalist arguments have been
maintained throughout the history of philosophy

00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:31.380
going right back to the ancient Greeks,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.289
but in the context of modern philosophy,

00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:34.538
the man we must look to

00:10:34.538 --> 00:10:36.160
in order to understand nominalism

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.179
is Thomas Hobbes.

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:39.790
Hobbes comes onto the scene
during the Renaissance,

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.630
and was deeply influenced by the new,

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.090
scientific attitude that
was proliferated at the time.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.520
He constructed his philosophy

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.314
using the methods found in geometry.

00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:49.497
That is: he would start with basic axioms,

00:10:49.497 --> 00:10:51.186
which were then used to produce lemmas,

00:10:51.186 --> 00:10:52.610
and draw further implications,

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.130
until you have an entire system.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.117
The axioms he chose

00:10:55.117 --> 00:10:57.367
were the basic premises of modern science.

00:10:57.367 --> 00:10:59.271
He was second-rate in this sense

00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:00.821
—unlike better philosophers,

00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:02.360
he merely accepted the principles

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.749
that were proliferated by others

00:11:03.749 --> 00:11:04.850
without questioning them.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.139
The Platonists would tell him

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:07.510
that the mind is supernatural,

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.670
he would accept this on its face,

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.681
and by that token
reject the faculty of consciousness.

00:11:11.681 --> 00:11:14.933
Hobbes was accordingly
a total materialist on metaphysics

00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:16.422
—everything is matter in motion,

00:11:16.422 --> 00:11:18.552
just like the particles studied by the physicists,

00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:20.537
or the chemicals studied by the chemists.

00:11:20.537 --> 00:11:22.931
Thus there is no such thing as purpose, or goal,

00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:25.826
there are only what Aristotle
called “efficient” causes

00:11:25.826 --> 00:11:27.193
—i.e. all of existence

00:11:27.193 --> 00:11:29.232
is like a big swirling mess of billiard balls

00:11:29.232 --> 00:11:32.156
whose motion is entirely pre-determined
by the laws of mechanics.

00:11:32.156 --> 00:11:34.800
Of course, by the time
Hobbes gets to his epistemology

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.103
–like all materialists

00:11:36.103 --> 00:11:37.590
–he has to smuggle in the mind,

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.251
as that is the very faculty
that epistemology studies.

00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:42.183
Again here, he merely accepts

00:11:42.183 --> 00:11:43.771
a pre-established position,

00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:45.218
namely empiricism

00:11:45.218 --> 00:11:47.929
—that all knowledge is based
on the evidence of the senses;

00:11:47.929 --> 00:11:49.810
there are no innate ideas or mystic means

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.762
of gaining knowledge on Hobbes’ philosophy.

00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:53.682
How then does he account for sense perception

00:11:53.682 --> 00:11:55.324
on purely materialist grounds?

00:11:55.324 --> 00:11:56.659
His idea, in basic terms,

00:11:56.659 --> 00:11:58.703
is that external matter strikes our body

00:11:58.703 --> 00:11:59.909
in specific locations

00:11:59.909 --> 00:12:01.196
which then sets off a chain

00:12:01.196 --> 00:12:02.810
of various oscillations and motions

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:03.639
towards the brain

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.220
according to the laws of mechanics

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.743
—and sensation is just the way

00:12:06.743 --> 00:12:08.624
in which we experience motions in the brain.

00:12:08.624 --> 00:12:10.392
What it means to “experience” anything

00:12:10.392 --> 00:12:11.988
if there is no such thing as a mind,

00:12:11.988 --> 00:12:13.751
nor why we only experience these motions

00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:14.984
in the brain but not elsewhere

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.274
is left entirely unclear,

00:12:16.274 --> 00:12:17.620
which is a bit of a problem.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.953
This is compounded further

00:12:18.953 --> 00:12:21.500
by his acceptance of what philosophers call

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.272
the primary/secondary quality distinction

00:12:23.272 --> 00:12:24.709
—that our senses only pick up

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:25.980
distorted impressions of what

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.940
is “really” out there,

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.367
such that the real world

00:12:28.367 --> 00:12:30.172
is not remotely what it appears to be.

00:12:30.172 --> 00:12:32.500
In actual fact, this position has it,

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.102
the real world is colourless, soundless, temperatureless, odourless, etc.

00:12:36.102 --> 00:12:38.794
All that really exists is quantity and motion.

00:12:38.794 --> 00:12:39.717
So, for Hobbes,

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:41.314
we know that the senses are invalid

00:12:41.314 --> 00:12:42.768
through a process of thought,

00:12:42.768 --> 00:12:44.420
and that thought is based

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.550
on the evidence of the senses;

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.299
so thought is supposed to invalidate

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:48.690
that which it is based upon.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.898
You can see, I’m sure,

00:12:49.898 --> 00:12:52.580
how the materialist position is leading Hobbes

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.681
to total epistemic suicide.

00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:54.604
Allow me to draw out

00:12:54.604 --> 00:12:55.769
just one aspect of this

00:12:55.769 --> 00:12:57.407
as it pertains to concepts.

00:12:57.407 --> 00:12:58.246
For Hobbes,

00:12:58.246 --> 00:12:59.970
thought is merely an image

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.712
—a decaying sense experience.

00:13:01.712 --> 00:13:03.481
The idea is that these motions

00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:04.613
and oscillations in the mind

00:13:04.613 --> 00:13:06.859
slowly fade away over time into noise.

00:13:06.859 --> 00:13:08.513
Because this applies to all thought,

00:13:08.513 --> 00:13:10.310
it applies also to concepts.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.238
This position is called sensualism

00:13:12.238 --> 00:13:13.853
—that all cognitive elements

00:13:13.853 --> 00:13:15.110
are sense perceptions.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.826
That the only cognitive faculty

00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:17.590
possessed by man

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.460
is that of sensation.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.540
Of course, on this view

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.810
where all man can do is sense things,

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.632
the only thing he can be cognisant of is particulars.

00:13:24.632 --> 00:13:26.174
In other words, on this view,

00:13:26.174 --> 00:13:27.792
it is not possible for man

00:13:27.792 --> 00:13:29.640
to abstract away from a number of particulars

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.790
to form concepts.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.450
This brings us squarely to nominalism:

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.572
that concepts are merely linguistic conventions,

00:13:35.572 --> 00:13:37.968
collective names arbitrarily imposed by men

00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:39.585
on roughly resembling particulars

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.019
on the standard of subjective human convenience.

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:44.134
That there are no <i>real</i> universals,

00:13:44.134 --> 00:13:46.451
particulars are the only things that exist.

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.608
That man <i>creates</i> classes of objects,

00:13:48.608 --> 00:13:50.306
rather than discovering them.

00:13:50.306 --> 00:13:52.235
This nominalist-sensualist position,

00:13:52.235 --> 00:13:54.103
which has been grafted onto empiricism

00:13:54.103 --> 00:13:55.250
since the renaissance,

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.852
yields disastrous consequences on philosophy.

00:13:57.852 --> 00:14:00.369
There can be no meaningful definitions
on this view,

00:14:00.369 --> 00:14:01.820
a definition is supposed to be

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.780
a statement of the essence of some class;

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.638
but if classification is subjective and arbitrary,

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.389
so too must definitions be.

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.275
Definitions can no longer be stated

00:14:10.275 --> 00:14:13.351
to be true or false,
just convenient or inconvenient

00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:16.200
—and there can be no objective
standard of convenience!

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.105
This then means that there
can be no general principles.

00:14:19.105 --> 00:14:20.763
If one says that man is mortal,

00:14:20.763 --> 00:14:22.970
or socialism is slavery;

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.465
he is counting upon the definitions of those terms.

00:14:24.465 --> 00:14:27.150
But those definitions are now said to be arbitrary,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.714
and so the general principles are also arbitrary

00:14:29.714 --> 00:14:32.674
and so falls away general objective principles.

00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:34.262
Every dispute over principles

00:14:34.262 --> 00:14:35.503
thus falls into the well

00:14:35.503 --> 00:14:37.170
of being a merely semantic disagreement

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.982
over how we are going to use words,

00:14:38.982 --> 00:14:42.211
rather than an actual dispute
over what is true or false.

00:14:42.211 --> 00:14:43.642
As Peikoff states the point:

00:14:43.642 --> 00:14:45.590
Now for instance

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.531
our communist comes in and says:

00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:50.367
"I have my own definition of slavery.

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:53.568
Slavery by my definition […]
is the state of being wrapped up

00:14:53.568 --> 00:14:56.567
in bondage to your own selfish interests,

00:14:56.567 --> 00:14:58.810
whereas true freedom I define

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:02.292
as the state of being released
from confining personal concerns

00:15:02.292 --> 00:15:05.646
and being compelled to serve
and love your brothers.”

00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:08.166
Well, if slavery is being egoistic

00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:11.396
and freedom is being
compelled to be self-sacrificial

00:15:11.396 --> 00:15:15.664
–and this is the Platonic-Hegelian
definition of freedom and slavery

00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:19.180
–then socialism is freedom,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.251
and capitalism does rest on slavery."

00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:24.509
Now here at least, the communist is asserting

00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:26.886
that their definition is correct
and mine is incorrect,

00:15:26.886 --> 00:15:28.328
so there is a possibility of debating

00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:30.620
who is right and how
the words should be used.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.176
The nominalist on the other hand

00:15:32.176 --> 00:15:33.719
completely rejects that its possible

00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:35.247
for a definition to be anything other

00:15:35.247 --> 00:15:37.370
than a linguistic contract of sorts.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.536
Thus when TIK says

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:39.983
that the standard of which
words should be used

00:15:39.983 --> 00:15:41.610
is those which are most accepted

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.340
and can thus be used to communicate,

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.207
and when he takes the historic
definition above all else,

00:15:46.207 --> 00:15:48.908
he is implicitly adopting
the nominalist viewpoint.

00:15:48.908 --> 00:15:51.650
That is to say: the fundamental principle

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.294
underlying definitions is not communication.

00:15:53.294 --> 00:15:55.592
Words are not mere linguistic playthings

00:15:55.592 --> 00:15:57.920
that we may select at will

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.242
and the standard of their truth

00:15:58.242 --> 00:16:00.335
is not that people use them in that way.

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:03.374
Definitions can be objectively correct or incorrect

00:16:03.374 --> 00:16:04.820
on epistemic grounds

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.888
—and thus epistemology must be employed

00:16:06.888 --> 00:16:09.159
when we are choosing which
definition to adopt.

00:16:09.159 --> 00:16:10.509
Now, I don’t think that TIK

00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:12.520
is a raging Humean or anything like that

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.846
—but this is an area where I think

00:16:13.846 --> 00:16:16.400
he is not applying the correct
methods of epistemology.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.701
He must take into account

00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:19.755
not only how the words are used,

00:16:19.755 --> 00:16:22.979
but more fundamentally what
the requirements of man’s mind are.

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:24.479
Furthermore, I also don’t think

00:16:24.479 --> 00:16:25.817
that TIK’s understanding of the state

00:16:25.817 --> 00:16:27.721
just being a large collection of people

00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:29.944
lines up with what most people think.

00:16:29.944 --> 00:16:31.762
It is my view that Murray Rothbard

00:16:31.762 --> 00:16:33.310
correctly identified what it is

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.428
that people mean when they say “state,”

00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:37.704
namely a monopoly on the use of force.

00:16:37.704 --> 00:16:40.830
They then combine this
with legal positivism

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:41.799
which almost everybody adopts,

00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:43.605
and thus conclude that the state is also

00:16:43.605 --> 00:16:46.429
a monopoly on the justification
of the use of force.

00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:48.129
Such that aggression done by the state

00:16:48.129 --> 00:16:50.304
or by the state’s order is justified,

00:16:50.304 --> 00:16:52.138
whereas other aggression is not.

00:16:52.138 --> 00:16:53.299
This is why people are fine

00:16:53.299 --> 00:16:54.764
with the government stealing their money,

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:56.479
but not a random thug on the street.

00:16:56.479 --> 00:16:57.307
After all,

00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:58.496
if you believe that there is

00:16:58.496 --> 00:17:00.412
a legitimate monopoly on the use of force,

00:17:00.412 --> 00:17:02.365
then that monopoly gets to decide

00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:04.711
that certain aggressions
are fine by pure fiat.

00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:07.519
A monopoly means that you
are excluding competition,

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:09.583
this means that if the state is justified

00:17:09.583 --> 00:17:11.569
it must be justified in preventing people

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.351
from defending property on their own,

00:17:13.351 --> 00:17:17.246
and therefore the state must be
operating under legal authoritarianism.

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:19.849
Now, I want to be clear here on one point

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.794
—TIK brought up in his video that it is wrong

00:17:21.794 --> 00:17:24.485
to <i>define</i> the state as being
coercive or aggressive

00:17:24.485 --> 00:17:27.344
because the dictionary definitions
do not mention coercion,

00:17:27.344 --> 00:17:30.890
and that I myself appeal to dictionary
definitions when it comes to socialism,

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.170
so it would be improper for me

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.597
to drop the dictionary all-together on this issue.

00:17:34.597 --> 00:17:36.157
First, I agree on the point

00:17:36.157 --> 00:17:39.505
that it is incorrect to make the state
coercive by definitional fiat;

00:17:39.505 --> 00:17:42.482
but I do not think that this is
what the Rothbardians are doing.

00:17:42.486 --> 00:17:43.983
Rather, Rothbard has identified

00:17:43.983 --> 00:17:45.710
that the essence of the state is to be

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.184
anti-productive, parasitic, monopolistic

00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:50.480
in the arena of the use of force
at the very least.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.190
Then on top of this he has
a separate legal theory

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.930
which identifies those activities
as being nocent.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.960
So its not that the state is
that organisation that is bad;

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.472
its rather the state is an organisation
that engages in certain activities

00:18:02.472 --> 00:18:05.039
that we have separately identified
as being bad.

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:07.619
As for the point that I use
dictionary definitions myself

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:10.970
in arguing that socialism is when
the government does stuff

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.232
this does not contradict the previous analysis

00:18:12.232 --> 00:18:14.560
of certain dictionary definitions being invalid.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.972
Those definitions were not
based on package deals

00:18:16.972 --> 00:18:18.819
or any other such flawed epistemology,

00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:21.705
and in fact identified the proper
essence of socialism

00:18:21.705 --> 00:18:24.569
—that socialism is when
the government does stuff.

00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:26.958
This is why it would be invalid for socialists

00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.710
to change the definition of socialism

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.803
to be when puppydogs and rainbows happen

00:18:30.803 --> 00:18:33.329
as that would not be digging
down to the essentials.

00:18:33.329 --> 00:18:35.907
Rather, what a definition like that is doing,

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:38.277
is it is substituting the expected outcome

00:18:38.277 --> 00:18:40.180
of some system for the system itself

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.125
—i.e. it is packaging together
what effects they think would occur

00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:46.844
with the things that they think
will cause those effects.

00:18:46.844 --> 00:18:48.312
This is invalid;

00:18:48.312 --> 00:18:51.231
the definition in this case needs
to identify the cause,

00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:53.684
and then further analysis can be performed

00:18:53.684 --> 00:18:56.186
to determine what the effect of
that cause will be.

00:18:56.186 --> 00:18:59.807
The change I propose to the definition
of the state is of a different sort

00:18:59.807 --> 00:19:02.510
—it is not an invalid poisoning of a term,

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.191
it is the removal of an already established poison.

00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:07.847
My claim is that the current dictionary definitions

00:19:07.847 --> 00:19:11.314
that TIK is working on are
in fact obfuscating the core,

00:19:11.314 --> 00:19:13.974
and that this obfuscation should be removed.

00:19:13.974 --> 00:19:15.860
Due to the time taken to make this video,

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.446
TIK has released a further video

00:19:17.446 --> 00:19:19.822
where he draws a connection
between the Austrian tradition

00:19:19.822 --> 00:19:21.515
that anarcho-capitalism is built on

00:19:21.515 --> 00:19:24.100
with the mystic philosophy of Immanuel Kant:

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.639
From John Locke and Kant

00:19:26.639 --> 00:19:30.188
we eventually get Ludwig von Mises,

00:19:30.188 --> 00:19:32.231
and the Austrian school of economics.

00:19:32.231 --> 00:19:35.325
And to prove the connection from Kant to Mises,

00:19:35.325 --> 00:19:38.717
here is an article from the Mises Institute <i>this year</i>,

00:19:38.717 --> 00:19:40.916
from the body of the article itself:

00:19:40.916 --> 00:19:45.978
“In the epistemological works of
Ludwig von Mises (1883–1971),

00:19:45.978 --> 00:19:48.434
there are not only clear parallels with

00:19:48.434 --> 00:19:52.142
but also lines of reference to
Kant’s theory of knowledge:

00:19:52.142 --> 00:19:57.520
Mises not only employs the term
a priori and occasionally references Kant,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.621
but also rationalizes the use of a priori knowledge

00:20:00.621 --> 00:20:04.956
as the appropriate method for
the social and economic sciences

00:20:04.956 --> 00:20:08.456
– the logic of human action (“praxeology”)."

00:20:08.456 --> 00:20:11.659
I know the Austrians have
historically challenged Hegel,

00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:14.200
so I know they’re not Hegelians,

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.718
but yes, Mises’ a priori reasoning actually comes

00:20:17.718 --> 00:20:20.788
from Immanuel Kant’s explanation of that

00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:23.791
meaning that there is a Kantian influence here.

00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:26.120
This is problematic because they

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.725
have allowed mysticism into their movement.

00:20:29.725 --> 00:20:32.990
<b>This might not affect their
basic economics as such,</b>

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:38.425
<b>but it does affect the more
in-depth stuff and their politics.</b>

00:20:38.425 --> 00:20:42.380
But Ayn Rand is absolutely not influenced

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.500
by Kant or Hegel whom she totally rejects.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.156
Her connection comes from Aristotle

00:20:48.156 --> 00:20:50.256
via Thomas Aquinas

00:20:50.256 --> 00:20:52.779
and is based in modern science.

00:20:52.779 --> 00:20:55.819
To be clear, I think this video is mostly correct;

00:20:55.819 --> 00:20:58.779
I even agree that this connection
between Kant and Mises

00:20:58.779 --> 00:21:00.594
has allowed some mystic elements

00:21:00.594 --> 00:21:02.763
to remain within the modern Austrian school.

00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:04.753
This is why my philosophical project,

00:21:04.753 --> 00:21:07.489
which is to integrate
Objectivism and anarcho-capitalism

00:21:07.489 --> 00:21:09.120
is so important;

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.178
and I will explain more on that later in the video

00:21:11.178 --> 00:21:13.652
when I respond to Ayn Rand’s
points against anarchism.

00:21:13.652 --> 00:21:16.699
Regardless I do have some things
I want to address here.

00:21:16.699 --> 00:21:19.706
First, I completely reject the claim
made by the article

00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:22.400
that any so-called “a priori reasoning”

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.330
forms “the most robust
epistemological foundation”

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.556
for economics, or even praxeology.

00:21:27.556 --> 00:21:30.800
And I further reject that
praxeology is even close

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.625
to being a sensible science on Kant’s philosophy.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.029
This is because praxeology
is just a certain science

00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:37.575
built on top of the understanding
that humans have free will.

00:21:37.575 --> 00:21:40.140
Following the naming schema
used for “praxeology,”

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.107
I propose that any science of free will

00:21:42.107 --> 00:21:43.936
falls under the banner “epilology,”

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:48.235
namely epilology includes
the sciences praxeology and thymology

00:21:48.235 --> 00:21:51.533
—with thymology studying
particular instances of man-made facts,

00:21:51.533 --> 00:21:55.424
and praxeology studying general statements
on the man-made as such.

00:21:55.424 --> 00:21:57.782
This gives us the proper conceptual distinction

00:21:57.782 --> 00:22:00.537
–not between a priori and a posteriori,

00:22:00.537 --> 00:22:02.967
or supposed facts of “pure” reason

00:22:02.967 --> 00:22:05.840
as against “mere” empirical
and contingent facts

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.925
–but between the conceptual and the perceptual

00:22:07.925 --> 00:22:09.610
—the general and the particular.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.455
For far too long, the Austrian school

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:12.891
has swallowed the poison pill

00:22:12.891 --> 00:22:15.984
that empiricism cannot yield
general and necessary truths,

00:22:15.984 --> 00:22:18.977
so they have turned to the evil
mysticism of Immanuel Kant,

00:22:18.977 --> 00:22:20.747
turning themselves away from reality

00:22:20.747 --> 00:22:22.438
to try get a better grasp of it.

00:22:22.438 --> 00:22:25.322
After all, the Objectivists have already provided

00:22:25.322 --> 00:22:27.920
a rational, this worldly, scientific account

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.671
of free will, and shown that without it
epistemology itself falls.

00:22:31.671 --> 00:22:34.434
The basic idea is that if determinism is true,

00:22:34.434 --> 00:22:37.410
then the determinist is pre-destined
to accept this position.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.931
How, then, does he hope to validate it?

00:22:39.931 --> 00:22:42.160
The factors that caused him to be a determinist

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.234
are clearly not infallible,

00:22:43.234 --> 00:22:46.453
as those same factors caused
other people to not be determinists

00:22:46.453 --> 00:22:49.350
—so he must accept that man
can think in error.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.779
Given the determinist’s mind is not
automatically attuned to reality,

00:22:52.779 --> 00:22:56.510
and he claims that he has no choice
over what he believes,

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.595
then he cannot validate any
belief that he holds

00:22:58.595 --> 00:23:01.960
—the determinist claims that on his own premises

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.124
he cannot deliberately choose
reality over fantasy.

00:23:04.124 --> 00:23:09.749
The concept of “volition” is one of
the roots of the concept of “validation”

00:23:09.749 --> 00:23:11.926
(and of its subdivisions, such as “proof”).

00:23:11.926 --> 00:23:14.842
A validation of ideas is necessary and possible

00:23:14.842 --> 00:23:17.683
only because man’s consciousness is volitional.

00:23:17.683 --> 00:23:21.850
This applies to any idea, including
the advocacy of free will,

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:29.159
to ask for its proof is to presuppose
the reality of free will.

00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:31.828
The determinist’s position
amounts to the following.

00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:35.900
“My mind does not automatically
conform to facts,

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.452
yet I have no choice about its course.

00:23:37.452 --> 00:23:40.573
I have no way to choose reality

00:23:40.573 --> 00:23:44.253
to be my guide as against
subjective feeling,

00:23:44.253 --> 00:23:49.983
social pressure, or the falsifications
inherent in being only semiconscious.

00:23:49.983 --> 00:23:54.152
If and when I distort the evidence
through sloppiness or laziness,

00:23:54.152 --> 00:23:56.714
or place popularity above logic,

00:23:56.714 --> 00:23:59.177
or evade out of fear,

00:23:59.177 --> 00:24:01.993
or hide my evasions from myself

00:24:01.993 --> 00:24:04.639
under layers of rationalizations and lies,

00:24:04.639 --> 00:24:07.993
I have to do it, even if I realize at the time

00:24:07.993 --> 00:24:09.404
how badly I am acting.

00:24:09.404 --> 00:24:11.293
Whatever the irrationalities

00:24:11.293 --> 00:24:14.575
that warp and invalidate my mind’s
conclusion on any issue,

00:24:14.575 --> 00:24:17.954
they are irresistible, like every
event in my history,

00:24:17.954 --> 00:24:19.972
and could not have been otherwise.”

00:24:19.972 --> 00:24:24.800
If such were the case, a man could not
rely on his own judgment.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.528
He could claim nothing as objective knowledge,

00:24:26.528 --> 00:24:28.609
including the theory of determinism.

00:24:28.609 --> 00:24:32.378
So, the Austrians are correct
to embrace a methodological dualism

00:24:32.378 --> 00:24:33.990
and reject the application of the methods

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.620
used to study particles and chemicals
to the study of man

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.291
—but not because the study of man
is non-empirical.

00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:41.570
Rather, when one studies human action,

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.168
he must take into account
the fact of free will.

00:24:44.168 --> 00:24:46.945
This integration between
Objectivism and anarcho-capitalism

00:24:46.945 --> 00:24:48.734
is not idiosyncratic either.

00:24:48.734 --> 00:24:50.879
Murray Rothbard himself was an Objectivist

00:24:50.879 --> 00:24:52.440
As he explains:

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.103
I just finished your novel today.

00:24:55.103 --> 00:24:58.381
I will start by saying that all of us
in the “Circle Bastiat”

00:24:58.381 --> 00:25:01.163
are convinced, and were convinced
very early in the reading,

00:25:01.163 --> 00:25:04.279
that Atlas Shrugged
is the greatest novel ever written.

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:06.540
But the truly staggering thing
about your novel

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.940
is the vast and completely integrated

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.819
edifice, of thought and of action:

00:25:12.819 --> 00:25:16.333
the astounding infinity
of rational connections

00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:18.506
that abound, great and small,

00:25:18.506 --> 00:25:19.828
throughout this novel.

00:25:19.828 --> 00:25:23.480
Joey says she used to wonder
how a novel could take you

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.473
over 10 years to write;

00:25:26.473 --> 00:25:29.936
she now wonders how

00:25:29.936 --> 00:25:31.987
you possibly could have written all that

00:25:31.987 --> 00:25:33.703
in a mere 10 years.

00:25:33.703 --> 00:25:36.626
Every page, almost every word,
has its meaning and function.

00:25:36.626 --> 00:25:39.500
I am sure that I have only
scratched the surface

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.774
of tracing all the interconnections,

00:25:40.774 --> 00:25:44.219
and a good part of my conversation
consists of saying;

00:25:44.219 --> 00:25:45.882
and what of page so-and-so:

00:25:45.882 --> 00:25:47.412
do you see how that fits in?

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:50.315
To find one person that has
carved out a completely integrated

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:52.199
rational ethic, rational epistemology,

00:25:52.199 --> 00:25:55.322
rational psychology, and rational politics,

00:25:55.322 --> 00:25:56.984
all integrated one with the other,

00:25:56.984 --> 00:25:59.278
and then to find each with the other

00:25:59.278 --> 00:26:01.130
portrayed through characters in action,

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.993
is a doubly staggering event.

00:26:02.993 --> 00:26:05.760
I am surprised that it astonishes even I

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.255
who was familiar with the general outlines

00:26:07.255 --> 00:26:08.121
of your system.

00:26:08.121 --> 00:26:11.370
What it will do the person stumbling
upon it anew I cannot imagine.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.200
For you have achieved

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.200
only the unity of principle and person,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.569
and of reason and passion,

00:26:15.569 --> 00:26:20.970
but also the unity of mind and body,

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.174
matter and spirit,

00:26:22.174 --> 00:26:24.683
sex and politics...

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:27.377
in short, to use the old Marxist phrase,

00:26:27.377 --> 00:26:30.108
“the unity of theory and practice.”

00:26:30.108 --> 00:26:32.194
I want you to know that,
even without seeing you,

00:26:32.194 --> 00:26:35.806
you have had an enormous influence upon me

00:26:35.806 --> 00:26:37.441
—even before the novel came out.

00:26:37.441 --> 00:26:39.240
When I first met you, many years ago,

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.738
I was a follower of Mises,

00:26:40.738 --> 00:26:43.730
but unhappy about his
antipathy to natural rights,

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:48.210
which I “felt” was true but could not demonstrate.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.155
You introduced me to the whole field

00:26:50.155 --> 00:26:53.334
of natural rights and natural law philosophy,

00:26:53.334 --> 00:26:54.812
which I did not know existed,

00:26:54.812 --> 00:26:55.977
and month by month,

00:26:55.977 --> 00:26:57.552
working on my own as I preferred,

00:26:57.552 --> 00:27:00.850
I learned and studied the glorious
natural rights tradition.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:04.997
I also learned from you about
the existence of Aristotelian epistemology,

00:27:04.997 --> 00:27:06.159
and then I studied that,

00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:08.110
and came to adopt it wholeheartedly.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.410
So that I owe you a great intellectual
debt for many years,

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.485
the least of which is introducing me
to a tradition

00:27:13.485 --> 00:27:16.219
of which four years of college
and three years of graduate school,

00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:17.589
to say nothing of other reading,

00:27:17.589 --> 00:27:19.179
had kept me in ignorance.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.080
Barbara Branden further notes
in her biography of Ayn Rand that:

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.875
Though disagreeing with Ayn Rand’s

00:27:25.875 --> 00:27:28.307
key concept of limited government,

00:27:28.307 --> 00:27:30.779
Murray Rothbard has stated that he

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:34.458
“is in agreement basically
with all her philosophy,”

00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:36.273
and that it was she who convinced him

00:27:36.273 --> 00:27:39.641
of the theory of natural rights
which his books uphold.

00:27:39.965 --> 00:27:42.500
I would certainly reject that limited government

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.279
is a “key” concept within Objectivism

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:47.830
—politics is held as being
a very remote branch of philosophy.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:48.930
But as stated I will address that point

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.644
more fully later in this video.

00:27:50.644 --> 00:27:52.739
Though I would like to give
some indication here

00:27:52.739 --> 00:27:54.123
as to why it is that Rothbard

00:27:54.123 --> 00:27:56.308
is basically never cited as an Objectivist,

00:27:56.308 --> 00:27:57.742
if he is indeed one.

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:59.907
Unfortunately, because of the Randians refusal

00:27:59.907 --> 00:28:02.454
to re-publish works without explicit permission,

00:28:02.454 --> 00:28:04.559
many of the sources on some of the things
I will state here

00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:05.960
point to ancient websites that have

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.635
since lost the relevant documents,

00:28:07.635 --> 00:28:09.519
so I can go only on things that I have heard

00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:10.493
other people saying.

00:28:10.493 --> 00:28:12.422
If any Randians get pissy about this,

00:28:12.422 --> 00:28:14.648
they are free to present
the relevant information in a form

00:28:14.648 --> 00:28:16.651
that has not been lost from the internet.

00:28:16.651 --> 00:28:17.979
I think that one of the major reasons

00:28:17.979 --> 00:28:19.857
why Rothbard is never called an Objectivist

00:28:19.857 --> 00:28:22.226
is one of the many disputes he had with Rand

00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:24.566
—namely that he neglected to cite Ayn Rand

00:28:24.566 --> 00:28:26.349
and her associates as sources.

00:28:26.349 --> 00:28:27.768
His reasoning is supposedly

00:28:27.768 --> 00:28:29.179
that he did not want a novellist

00:28:29.179 --> 00:28:31.766
to appear in the bibliography
of any academic work.

00:28:31.766 --> 00:28:35.485
In Rand’s place, Rothbard would cite
Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas

00:28:35.485 --> 00:28:38.839
as sources for things such as
the law of causality, or natural rights.

00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:40.272
I conjecture that this is

00:28:40.272 --> 00:28:42.363
the reason why you frequently find Rothbard

00:28:42.363 --> 00:28:43.620
being called a neo-Thomist,

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.519
or neo-Aristotelian rather than an Objectivist.

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:48.559
That is, the various dramas that went on

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:49.440
between two people

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.796
more than half a century ago

00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:53.240
have since impacted
the movements they founded,

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.600
such that modern anarcho-capitalists

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.538
refuse to align with Ayn Rand

00:28:56.538 --> 00:28:58.383
“because that’s what Rothbard did”

00:28:58.383 --> 00:29:01.384
and vice versa for Randians
often refusing to even consider

00:29:01.384 --> 00:29:04.880
whether further developments
in legal philosophy can be made.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.600
When it’s all said and done,

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.120
I think it is frankly ludicrous that

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.589
people who live decades after everyone involved

00:29:09.589 --> 00:29:11.364
in the various beefs have long since passed

00:29:11.364 --> 00:29:12.546
would still hold on

00:29:12.546 --> 00:29:14.471
to these grudges to the extent that

00:29:14.471 --> 00:29:15.389
they shut down their minds

00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:17.300
at any mention of debate.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.489
Yes, whether Rothbard plagiarised from Rand

00:29:19.489 --> 00:29:22.380
might be relevant to a moral
evaluation of Rothbard-the-man;

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.519
but it is not relevant to any evaluation

00:29:24.519 --> 00:29:26.519
of anarcho-capitalism the legal theory.

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:28.848
And, yes, whether Ayn Rand was a meany-pie

00:29:28.848 --> 00:29:30.220
to people who disagreed with her

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.315
might be relevant to a moral
evaluation of Ayn Rand-the-person;

00:29:33.315 --> 00:29:37.232
but it is not relevant to any
evaluation of Objectivism the philosophy.

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:39.483
It certainly isn’t <i>every</i> Objectivist

00:29:39.483 --> 00:29:42.380
or <i>every</i> anarcho-capitalist
who operates in this way,

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.760
but it is enough that
it is worth calling out here:

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.600
drop the beefs of dead people
—they are utterly irrelevant.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.200
There is one last point on this front,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.529
which is that Rothbard did make

00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:53.760
frequent use of the Kantian terminology.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.520
He explains why he does so,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.702
despite not being a Kantian:

00:29:56.944 --> 00:29:58.399
Whether we consider

00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:00.720
the Action Axiom “a priori” or “empirical”

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.803
depends on our ultimate philosophical position.

00:30:02.803 --> 00:30:05.193
Professor Mises, in the neo-Kantian tradition,

00:30:05.193 --> 00:30:07.203
considers this axiom a <i>law of thought</i>

00:30:07.203 --> 00:30:08.908
and therefore a categorical truth

00:30:08.908 --> 00:30:10.688
<i>a priori</i> to all experience.

00:30:10.688 --> 00:30:12.895
My own epistemological position rests on

00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:15.200
Aristotle and St.Thomas rather than Kant,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.740
and hence I would interpret

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.120
the proposition differently.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.920
I would consider the axiom

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.126
a <i>law of reality</i> rather than a law of thought,

00:30:23.126 --> 00:30:27.662
and hence “empirical” rather than “a priori.”

00:30:27.662 --> 00:30:30.519
But it should be obvious that this type of “empiricism”

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:33.120
is so out of step with modern empiricism

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.951
[i.e. nominalism-sensualism]

00:30:34.951 --> 00:30:39.494
that I may just as well continue
to call it <i>a priori</i> for present purposes.

00:30:39.494 --> 00:30:43.390
For (1) it is a law of reality

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.519
that is not conceivably falsifiable,

00:30:45.519 --> 00:30:48.249
and yet is empirically meaningful and true;

00:30:48.249 --> 00:30:51.711
(2) it rests on universal <i>inner</i> experience,

00:30:51.711 --> 00:30:54.170
and not simply on external experience,

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.230
that is, its evidence is <i>reflective</i>
rather than physical;

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.938
and (3) it is clearly <i>a priori</i> to complex historical events.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:01.710
So, from the very beginning,

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.960
anarcho-capitalism and
the Rothbardian wing of the Austrian school

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.400
owe their fundamental philosophy to Ayn Rand

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.922
—not Immanuel Kant.

00:31:08.922 --> 00:31:10.233
Moving on from TIK now,

00:31:10.233 --> 00:31:13.610
I must address those who would
seek to call anarchism chaotic

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.870
by conflating it with the law of the jungle

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.639
—the idea that anything goes
as far as law is concerned.

00:31:17.639 --> 00:31:21.830
Recall above that anarchism must be
opposed to legal authoritarianism

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.487
—the theory that the correct
way to resolve conflicts

00:31:23.487 --> 00:31:25.129
is by appealing to some authority.

00:31:25.129 --> 00:31:27.400
Notice then that the law of the jungle

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.867
in its many forms therefore cannot be anarchist.

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:31.902
If the claim is that might makes right,

00:31:31.902 --> 00:31:33.519
then the mighty justify their claim

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:35.828
by demonstrating that they
are the authority on law

00:31:35.828 --> 00:31:38.340
by virtue of having
the biggest stick in the land.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.999
Certainly, this is not anarchist in the slightest.

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:43.180
Anarchism does not mean no laws,

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.639
having no laws is impossible

00:31:44.639 --> 00:31:46.410
—anarchism rather means that those laws

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.827
are natural and peaceful.

00:31:47.827 --> 00:31:49.376
This provides a retort also

00:31:49.376 --> 00:31:50.950
to the various other primitive, brutish,

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.907
and/or stupid varieties
of supposed-anarchist thought:

00:31:53.907 --> 00:31:56.540
chief among them the “anarcho-communists.”

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.799
The term itself is a clear contradiction.

00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:00.919
Communism holds that total metaphysical,

00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:02.780
epistemic, ethical, aesthetic,

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.137
and legal authority lies with the collective

00:32:05.137 --> 00:32:07.643
—and that accordingly the proper
way to resolve conflicts

00:32:07.643 --> 00:32:09.633
is for the individual
to be crushed under the boot

00:32:09.633 --> 00:32:10.995
and be made to be a complete slave

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:12.441
to the whims of the egregore.

00:32:12.441 --> 00:32:15.708
The communist cannot, therefore,
appeal to any naturalistic understanding

00:32:15.708 --> 00:32:18.622
of which individual ought be given
precedence in some conflict,

00:32:18.622 --> 00:32:20.635
as he does not recognise the individual as being

00:32:20.635 --> 00:32:22.789
a self-sufficient existent in the first place.

00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:24.466
This is why anarcho-capitalism

00:32:24.466 --> 00:32:26.624
is the only proper variant
of anarchist thought.

00:32:26.624 --> 00:32:28.383
The capitalism implies the anarchism

00:32:28.383 --> 00:32:30.549
and the anarchism implies the capitalism.

00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:32.172
Capitalism implies anarchism

00:32:32.172 --> 00:32:34.400
because the recognition of
full private property rights

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.308
implies there can be no legal authorities

00:32:36.308 --> 00:32:38.119
that may flout or change those rights;

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:39.829
and anarchism implies capitalism

00:32:39.829 --> 00:32:41.919
because with no authorities to appeal to,

00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:43.757
we are left with the
non-aggression principle,

00:32:43.757 --> 00:32:45.890
which implies full private property rights.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.976
The origin of this conflation
between anarchism and jungle ethics

00:32:48.976 --> 00:32:52.981
is found in those who freeze legal positivism
to the broader abstraction of law:

00:32:52.981 --> 00:32:58.172
A fallacy which may be termed
“the fallacy of the frozen abstraction”

00:32:58.172 --> 00:33:02.190
consists of substituting some
one particular concrete

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.350
for the wider abstract class
to which it belongs

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.159
—[e.g.,] substituting
a specific ethics (altruism)

00:33:09.159 --> 00:33:11.920
for the wider abstraction of “ethics.”

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.191
Thus, a man may reject the theory of altruism

00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:19.658
and assert that he has accepted a rational code

00:33:19.658 --> 00:33:22.902
—but, failing to integrate his ideas,

00:33:22.902 --> 00:33:25.556
he continues unthinkingly to approach

00:33:25.556 --> 00:33:29.687
ethical questions in terms established by altruism.

00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:31.697
Legal positivism is

00:33:31.697 --> 00:33:34.279
one specific theory about what the law is,

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:35.910
namely it is the thesis that

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.542
the existence and content of law

00:33:37.542 --> 00:33:40.311
depends upon social facts, and not on its merits.

00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:42.370
In other words, the legal positivist

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.197
claims that law is “posited,”

00:33:44.197 --> 00:33:45.933
i.e. decreed by some authority,

00:33:45.933 --> 00:33:48.020
rather than discovered by jurists.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.584
This leaves us with a gross false alternative:

00:33:50.584 --> 00:33:52.572
arbitrary law declared by politicians

00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:55.240
vs arbitrary law declared by bandits;

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.791
agression vs agression;

00:33:56.791 --> 00:33:58.920
might vs might.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.040
It is the dictum of every great villain
in the history of philosophy:

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.590
heads I win, tails you lose.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.542
"Fight the doctrine which
slaughters the individual

00:34:05.542 --> 00:34:07.653
with a doctrine which
slaughters the individual.

00:34:07.653 --> 00:34:09.000
Give up your soul to a council

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.240
–or give it up to a leader.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:10.842
But give it up,

00:34:10.842 --> 00:34:11.349
give it up,

00:34:11.479 --> 00:34:12.130
give it up.

00:34:12.246 --> 00:34:13.680
My technique, Peter.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.291
Offer poison as food and poison as antidote.

00:34:16.291 --> 00:34:17.354
Go fancy on the trimmings,

00:34:17.354 --> 00:34:19.371
but hang on to the main objective.

00:34:19.371 --> 00:34:20.657
Give the fools a choice,

00:34:20.657 --> 00:34:21.782
let them have their fun

00:34:21.782 --> 00:34:23.341
–but don’t forget the only purpose

00:34:23.341 --> 00:34:24.849
you have to accomplish.

00:34:24.849 --> 00:34:25.854
Kill the individual.

00:34:25.854 --> 00:34:27.120
Kill man’s soul.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.300
The rest will follow automatically."

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.682
The jungle anarchist accepts and furthers

00:34:31.682 --> 00:34:35.980
the brutish violence vs brutish violence
false alternative;

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.271
taking up the side of disorganised aggression

00:34:37.271 --> 00:34:39.320
as against organised aggression.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.895
He never stops to check his premises

00:34:40.895 --> 00:34:43.699
and question whether aggression
is required in the first place.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.515
He merely asserts that somebody’s got to rule,

00:34:45.515 --> 00:34:48.589
so its better if that ruling is done
by syndicates, or cooperatives,

00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:49.750
or random Stirnerites

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.538
rather than a union of syndicates,

00:34:51.538 --> 00:34:53.620
or democratic republic,

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.265
or a specific Stirnerite called “dear leader.”

00:34:55.265 --> 00:34:58.630
Surely this is as far from
any reasonable conception

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.505
of anarchist as one can come.

00:34:59.505 --> 00:35:01.558
Indeed, these anarcho-idiots

00:35:01.558 --> 00:35:03.925
are entirely correct
to segregate anarcho-capitalism

00:35:03.925 --> 00:35:06.565
from their various moronic
and/or brutish creeds,

00:35:06.565 --> 00:35:08.447
as they nearly universally do.

00:35:08.447 --> 00:35:09.564
When you see such attempts

00:35:09.564 --> 00:35:11.600
made to kick anarcho-capitalism out

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.750
from under the flag of “mother anarchy,”

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.543
you should not protest their disassociation from us.

00:35:15.543 --> 00:35:17.661
Rather, you should embrace this and point out

00:35:17.661 --> 00:35:20.168
that they are distancing
<i>themselves</i> from anarchism.

00:35:20.168 --> 00:35:23.786
Their facts are correct, but their
evaluation is sorely reversed.

00:35:23.786 --> 00:35:25.289
Now that it has been established

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:27.529
that anarchism is definitively not chaos,

00:35:27.529 --> 00:35:29.409
it is worth explaining exactly how

00:35:29.409 --> 00:35:32.217
defense services could be provided
on the free market.

00:35:32.217 --> 00:35:33.997
After all, some people are criminal,

00:35:33.997 --> 00:35:36.525
and the free society would need
a way to deal with them.

00:35:36.525 --> 00:35:38.530
It is a general rule of economics

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:39.674
that a free market can more efficiently

00:35:39.674 --> 00:35:41.909
provide any good than state central planning;

00:35:41.909 --> 00:35:43.570
however, because of that

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.309
it is not possible for me to explain
the specific bureaucratic structure

00:35:46.309 --> 00:35:47.560
that would obtain on the market

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.747
to provide the service
of defending one’s rights.

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:50.967
Just as it wouldn’t be possible

00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:53.100
to explain what the restaurant
industry would look like

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.209
before one had developed.

00:35:54.209 --> 00:35:55.890
Regardless, it is possible to discuss

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.535
some likely or possible
features that could exist.

00:35:58.535 --> 00:36:02.480
First, I must deconstruct
the myth of collective security,

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.414
most prominently advanced by Thomas Hobbes.

00:36:04.414 --> 00:36:06.340
The destruction he wrought in epistemology

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.810
by conflating empiricism with
nominalism-sensualism

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:11.560
can be found in the political realm also

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.561
—it is accepted by legion political
philosophers and economists

00:36:14.561 --> 00:36:16.217
that a only a state can provide security

00:36:16.217 --> 00:36:18.730
against invasions of one’s property.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.214
The argument goes that in the state of nature

00:36:20.214 --> 00:36:21.783
men are all snarling beasts

00:36:21.783 --> 00:36:23.698
who are constantly at each others throats,

00:36:23.698 --> 00:36:25.480
doing anything in their power to invade

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.830
and expropriate what has been
produced by others.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.378
In other words, Hobbes has it

00:36:29.378 --> 00:36:32.320
that there would be a permanent
underproduction of security

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.940
—each individual, left to his own devices,

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.810
would spend too little on his own defense,

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.167
thus constant interpersonal warfare would result.

00:36:39.833 --> 00:36:43.508
The solution to this presumably
intolerable situation,

00:36:43.508 --> 00:36:45.731
according to Hobbes and his followers,

00:36:45.731 --> 00:36:48.140
is the institution of a state.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.283
In order to institute peaceful
cooperation among themselves,

00:36:52.283 --> 00:36:54.820
two individuals, A and B,

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.818
require a third independent party, S,

00:36:58.818 --> 00:37:01.672
as ultimate judge and peacemaker.

00:37:01.672 --> 00:37:05.444
However, this third party, S,
is not just another individual,

00:37:05.444 --> 00:37:07.820
and the good provided by S,

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.280
that of security,

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.958
is not just another “private” good.

00:37:11.958 --> 00:37:16.727
Rather, S is a <i>sovereign</i> and has
as such two unique powers.

00:37:16.727 --> 00:37:21.218
On the one hand, S can insist
that his <i>subjects</i>, A and B

00:37:21.218 --> 00:37:24.177
not seek protection from anyone but him;

00:37:24.177 --> 00:37:30.160
that is, S is a compulsory
territorial monopolist of protection.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.039
On the other hand,
S can determine unilaterally

00:37:34.039 --> 00:37:37.595
how much A and B must spend
on their own security;

00:37:37.595 --> 00:37:40.940
that is, S has the power to impose taxes

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.897
in order to provide security “collectively.”

00:37:44.897 --> 00:37:46.922
On its face, even if we grant the premise

00:37:46.922 --> 00:37:49.964
that men are brutes who must
necessarily be at war with each other,

00:37:49.964 --> 00:37:51.760
it is entirely unclear how exactly

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.741
this is any solution to this problem at all.

00:37:53.741 --> 00:37:56.303
Surely the sovereign is just
as brutish as his subjects

00:37:56.303 --> 00:37:58.319
and now has the territorial monopoly

00:37:58.319 --> 00:37:59.522
and compulsory funding

00:37:59.522 --> 00:38:01.410
to externalise the costs of his aggression

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.880
onto a vast array of victims

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.294
who are forced to pay for their own victimisation.

00:38:05.294 --> 00:38:07.889
It is clear that this sovereign
is no protector at all

00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:10.109
—rather, he is the greatest brute of them all.

00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:11.840
A rights-protecting violator of rights

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.923
is simply a contradiction in terms.

00:38:13.923 --> 00:38:17.528
Furthermore, so long as
multiple states, S1, ..., Sn, exist,

00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:19.509
just as there is supposed
to be constant warfare

00:38:19.509 --> 00:38:21.409
between A and B in the state of anarchy

00:38:21.409 --> 00:38:24.700
so too must there be constant warfare
between these different states.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.880
Indeed, we do find that states
engage in near constant war with each other,

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.457
so this could be a point in favour of Hobbes

00:38:30.457 --> 00:38:32.389
and would imply that a world government must be

00:38:32.389 --> 00:38:34.436
implemented to reduce the levels of violence.

00:38:34.436 --> 00:38:36.385
However, this point does not account

00:38:36.385 --> 00:38:37.920
for the actual observed relations

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.880
between the subjects of different states.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.340
These subjects are just as surely in
a state of anarchy with respect to each other

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.454
as they would be without any states at all,

00:38:45.454 --> 00:38:47.748
but we find that the private
dealings between individuals

00:38:47.748 --> 00:38:49.640
who reside in different countries

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.269
are for the most part entirely amicable.

00:38:51.269 --> 00:38:53.160
Moreover, it is also not clear how

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.203
such a world government would be
an improvement in the provision of security

00:38:56.203 --> 00:38:58.760
as compared to competing private firms

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.375
and individual defense.

00:38:59.375 --> 00:39:01.950
For this state would have to be
the winner of all wars,

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.299
the biggest brute in the land,

00:39:03.299 --> 00:39:06.375
the most skilled at expropriating
its subjects to fund violence

00:39:06.375 --> 00:39:09.286
and the most capable at engaging
in violence ever seen.

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:12.200
This would then not be
the most protective agency ever,

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.599
but the complete opposite

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:15.704
—it would be the last surviving
protection racket.

00:39:15.704 --> 00:39:17.200
This makes it the biggest danger

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.850
that any man would face in his life.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:21.866
and it is specifically this danger
that Hobbes advocates

00:39:21.866 --> 00:39:23.734
be free to do as it pleases.

00:39:23.734 --> 00:39:25.278
At least in his state of nature

00:39:25.278 --> 00:39:27.437
it is possible for me to overwhelm a single foe

00:39:27.437 --> 00:39:29.484
who attempts to waylay me on the side of the road

00:39:29.484 --> 00:39:31.600
—but what possible means of defense
could I muster

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.900
against the giga-Leviathan,

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.991
which has already proven itself
to be superlative at the craft of war?

00:39:35.991 --> 00:39:37.321
So the Hobbesian myth stands

00:39:37.321 --> 00:39:38.753
as completely false and absurd

00:39:38.753 --> 00:39:40.396
<i>even if</i> one grants the premise

00:39:40.396 --> 00:39:42.162
that men are naturally brutish

00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:44.553
—but let’s go further and examine this premise.

00:39:44.553 --> 00:39:46.290
First, man has free will

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:51.400
and can as such choose either
peaceful productivity or brutish anti-productivity.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.415
It is in the world where the philosophy
of the day is that of evasion

00:39:54.415 --> 00:39:57.426
that a correspondent brutishness
and statism arise;

00:39:57.426 --> 00:40:00.704
if the philosophy of the day
were one of thought and objectivity,

00:40:00.704 --> 00:40:03.858
then men would understand
that production is the proper way to live.

00:40:03.858 --> 00:40:05.642
So contrary to the claim at hand,

00:40:05.642 --> 00:40:09.330
it is not that a state is required
to civilise naturally brutish men;

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.462
rather it is that when men choose brutality

00:40:11.462 --> 00:40:13.293
they form states to engage in it.

00:40:13.293 --> 00:40:16.366
Furthermore, the entire purpose of
protecting rights in the first place

00:40:16.366 --> 00:40:18.674
is to allow for the flourishing of mankind.

00:40:18.674 --> 00:40:21.141
The reason why Crusoe would
want to be free of conflict

00:40:21.141 --> 00:40:22.782
is so that he can be productive.

00:40:22.782 --> 00:40:25.200
Thus shifting the infringement of rights

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.502
onto an institutionalised
(protected) anti-productive class

00:40:28.502 --> 00:40:30.321
is an anathema to the very problem

00:40:30.321 --> 00:40:32.161
that had to be solved in the first place,

00:40:32.161 --> 00:40:36.469
as such an institution would tend
to maximise the price of protection (i.e. taxes)

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:38.244
whilst minimising the quality.

00:40:38.244 --> 00:40:40.453
Quite simply, given that
the principle of government

00:40:40.453 --> 00:40:43.156
requires that it be a judicial monopoly
with the power to tax,

00:40:43.156 --> 00:40:45.128
any notion of limiting it’s power

00:40:45.128 --> 00:40:47.373
and safeguarding individual life and property

00:40:47.373 --> 00:40:48.336
is illusory;

00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:51.430
necessarily the state tends
towards greater expropriation

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:52.460
and less protection,

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.620
because the sovereign is
motivated by self-interest

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.605
(albeit irrational)

00:40:55.605 --> 00:40:58.120
and the disutility of labour just as anyone else.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.120
Why allocate more resources
towards protecting citizens

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.370
than the minimum required to keep them in line

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:04.119
and preserve their property

00:41:04.119 --> 00:41:05.858
for your own future expropriation?

00:41:05.858 --> 00:41:08.295
On Hobbes, the sovereign would <i>have</i> to do this

00:41:08.295 --> 00:41:10.160
because he is supposed to be a brute.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.520
Furthermore, even if the sovereign is,

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.338
contrary to the Hobbesian premise,

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:16.180
an angel who wants to try his best

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.793
to provide the correct level of protection,

00:41:17.793 --> 00:41:19.977
it is simply not possible for him to do this.

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:22.127
He is faced with the unanswerable question

00:41:22.127 --> 00:41:24.701
of how much security must be rationally allocated

00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:26.727
and in what form(s) it should be produced.

00:41:26.727 --> 00:41:28.522
Should he give every citizen a handgun?

00:41:28.522 --> 00:41:30.614
Should he post armed guards
on every street corner?

00:41:30.614 --> 00:41:32.954
Should he have a police patrol every 10 miles?

00:41:32.954 --> 00:41:34.148
He cannot answer,

00:41:34.148 --> 00:41:37.880
because the economic calculation problem
stands in his way.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.322
I have already explained the ECP in this video,

00:41:39.322 --> 00:41:41.302
so I will not repeat the explanation here.

00:41:41.302 --> 00:41:43.640
You can read the full
deductive argument on my wiki

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.230
if you do not wish to watch the video.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:47.870
Regardless, in the statist society

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.712
there will also exist a tendency

00:41:48.712 --> 00:41:51.143
toward a deterioration in the quality of justice,

00:41:51.143 --> 00:41:52.600
because if one can only appeal

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.530
to the government for justice and protection,

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:56.145
justice and protection will invariably

00:41:56.145 --> 00:41:58.148
be perverted in favour of the government.

00:41:58.148 --> 00:42:00.394
Even the constitutions and supreme courts

00:42:00.394 --> 00:42:01.647
that are supposed to limit this

00:42:01.647 --> 00:42:04.644
may be interpreted and administered
solely by the government

00:42:04.644 --> 00:42:06.660
—the very agents who are supposed to be limited

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.748
are the ones who determine what the limit is.

00:42:08.748 --> 00:42:11.239
“Accordingly, the definition of
property and protection

00:42:11.239 --> 00:42:12.831
will continually be altered

00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:14.200
and the range of jurisdiction

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.350
expanded to the government’s advantage.”

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.454
It is in the near universal acceptance of

00:42:18.454 --> 00:42:19.932
the myth of collective security

00:42:19.932 --> 00:42:22.635
that we find another odious false alternative.

00:42:22.635 --> 00:42:26.376
On the one hand, the so-called capitalists
accept Hobbes’ premises,

00:42:26.376 --> 00:42:28.844
then conclude that the only way to
protect private property

00:42:28.844 --> 00:42:30.748
is to collectivise the invasions thereof;

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:34.500
and on the other hand, the communists
will accept the same premises,

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.525
and claim the banner of anarchism

00:42:35.525 --> 00:42:38.170
as an anti-capitalist,
anti-property stance.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:42.219
We are left yet again with
the alternative of collectivism vs collectivism.

00:42:42.219 --> 00:42:45.779
Now that the fundamental philosophical
backing for statism is in ruin,

00:42:45.779 --> 00:42:47.545
I may build the positive case

00:42:47.545 --> 00:42:49.290
for the private production of defense.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:52.835
First, the threat of aggression
against one’s property is a form of risk,

00:42:52.835 --> 00:42:55.687
and there are two potential ways
to deal with any risk on the market:

00:42:55.687 --> 00:42:58.215
(1) through your own privately controlled means;

00:42:58.215 --> 00:43:00.923
and (2) through the use of an insurance agency.

00:43:00.923 --> 00:43:02.319
So, we must analyse

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:04.200
whether defense is an insurable good.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.200
After all, I may not take out

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.550
against <i>any</i> risk that I face

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.160
—namely, I cannot insure myself against those risks

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.989
whose outcome I have control over.

00:43:12.989 --> 00:43:15.280
On the market I could not rightly get insurance

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.823
against setting my own house on fire,

00:43:16.823 --> 00:43:18.913
as I could then simply pay in the first premium,

00:43:18.913 --> 00:43:20.200
set my house alight,

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.640
and immediately get compensation

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.120
—such a non-discriminatory insurance
firm could not profit.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.701
So clearly a defense insurer

00:43:26.701 --> 00:43:28.410
could not insure one against any aggression

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.140
that they themselves provoke.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.516
Norms of peaceful, conflict-avoiding conduct

00:43:32.516 --> 00:43:34.675
would have to be implemented into the contracts

00:43:34.675 --> 00:43:37.467
which would bind the insured
to civilised behaviour.

00:43:37.467 --> 00:43:40.318
In defending against any risk
that is non-insurable,

00:43:40.318 --> 00:43:42.599
one must utilise their own personal means,

00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:44.200
which would still be far more effective

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.895
than the current heavily restricted
weapons that the state allows one to possess.

00:43:47.895 --> 00:43:50.161
Moreover, any defensive action taken

00:43:50.161 --> 00:43:53.176
–either by an insurance firm or in personal self-defense–

00:43:53.176 --> 00:43:55.826
would tend to minimise any collateral damage.

00:43:55.826 --> 00:43:58.930
This is because if in the process of
some defensive action

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.606
I thereby damage the insured
property of innocents

00:44:01.606 --> 00:44:04.696
I will have to face not a sole
aggressor or small gang,

00:44:04.696 --> 00:44:08.630
but a large firm capable of
extracting restitution from me.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.587
As such, collectivist weapons such as bombs,

00:44:10.587 --> 00:44:12.760
weaponised diseases, and chemical attacks

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.248
would tend to not be used

00:44:14.248 --> 00:44:15.714
in favor of precision strikes

00:44:15.714 --> 00:44:17.798
against only aggressive targets.

00:44:17.798 --> 00:44:22.550
This is quite on the contrary to current
statist methods of invasion and retaliation

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.605
which make frequent use of collective attacks;

00:44:24.605 --> 00:44:27.209
not caring in the slightest about collateral damage,

00:44:27.209 --> 00:44:30.153
or in some cases, even
maximising collateral damage.

00:44:30.153 --> 00:44:32.583
After all, when it comes to interstate warfare,

00:44:32.583 --> 00:44:34.953
killing off the civilian population of your enemy

00:44:34.953 --> 00:44:37.296
reduces the total pool of taxable resources

00:44:37.296 --> 00:44:39.587
available to the enemy state in the future.

00:44:39.587 --> 00:44:40.817
In addition to this tendency

00:44:40.817 --> 00:44:42.817
for free-market defense towards precision

00:44:42.817 --> 00:44:44.609
in lieu of sweeping destruction;

00:44:44.609 --> 00:44:46.210
any defense insurance firm

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:48.950
would have both the incentive
to provide effective defense

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:51.643
and likely the resources to engage in it.

00:44:51.643 --> 00:44:54.110
Even in their heavily restricted form today,

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.617
insurance firms control vast arrays of capital

00:44:56.617 --> 00:44:58.200
spread across the globe

00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.443
which they can use to compensate

00:44:59.443 --> 00:45:01.488
anyone who makes a claim on their policy.

00:45:01.488 --> 00:45:05.304
After all, if an insurer does not
have such a warchest of resources,

00:45:05.304 --> 00:45:07.709
nobody would trust them to have
the means to pay up

00:45:07.709 --> 00:45:08.804
should the time come.

00:45:08.804 --> 00:45:10.722
Thus they would have to publicly show

00:45:10.722 --> 00:45:13.157
that they are in control of great capital holdings

00:45:13.157 --> 00:45:15.894
not subject to the risk of immediate state seizure.

00:45:15.894 --> 00:45:18.414
Because these firms would have to
dip into their own resources

00:45:18.414 --> 00:45:21.319
to pay off anyone whose property
was not adequately protected,

00:45:21.319 --> 00:45:23.858
they have the incentive not just to
vigorously track down

00:45:23.858 --> 00:45:25.830
and extract restitution from the criminals,

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.219
but also to efficiently predict

00:45:27.219 --> 00:45:29.316
and mitigate crime before it happens;

00:45:29.316 --> 00:45:31.740
which is in stark distinction to the state method

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.599
of forcing victims to pay for the shelter,

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:36.585
feeding, and entertainment of
their aggressors through taxation.

00:45:36.585 --> 00:45:39.329
This tendency enacts a civilising process,

00:45:39.329 --> 00:45:41.530
in contrast to the decivilising one

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:44.805
created by monopoly “protection” under a state.

00:45:44.805 --> 00:45:46.456
All other things being equal,

00:45:46.456 --> 00:45:49.670
men would prefer to have their
property under a lower risk of predation;

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.714
so as the risk of aggression increases,

00:45:51.714 --> 00:45:53.651
the value of property decreases.

00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:56.509
On the one hand, in low-risk-high-value

00:45:56.509 --> 00:45:58.282
(i.e. “good”) neighborhoods,

00:45:58.282 --> 00:46:01.668
insurance rates could be low
in accordance with the low risk of predation;

00:46:01.668 --> 00:46:04.720
and on the other hand, in high-risk-low-value

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.720
(i.e. “bad”) neighborhoods,

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.742
insurance rates would be accordingly higher.

00:46:07.742 --> 00:46:09.240
This creates a tendency

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.750
for productive individuals to move to
and invest their resources

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:14.398
in good as against bad areas.

00:46:14.398 --> 00:46:18.302
In contrast, those who are in good neighborhoods
under state-monopoly protection

00:46:18.302 --> 00:46:21.127
are forced to pay more in taxes
in order to subsidise

00:46:21.127 --> 00:46:23.463
those who languish in the bad neighborhoods

00:46:23.463 --> 00:46:26.842
—shifting resources from civilisation
to decivilisation.

00:46:26.842 --> 00:46:30.185
Not only does this hypothetical
free-market in defensive services

00:46:30.185 --> 00:46:32.753
have the benefits that there
would tend to not be total war,

00:46:32.753 --> 00:46:34.845
the victims would be compensated
rather than the aggressors,

00:46:34.845 --> 00:46:39.128
and that accordingly resources are shifted away
from predation and towards production;

00:46:39.128 --> 00:46:41.445
but also even current insurance agencies

00:46:41.445 --> 00:46:45.880
already utilise free market
arbitration systems rather than statist courts.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.209
These free-market dispute resolution firms

00:46:48.209 --> 00:46:50.319
would only become more effective and

00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:55.402
more broadly used without the state forcefully
positioning itself as the “true” “court of the land”

00:46:55.402 --> 00:46:59.256
that may be appealed to if one does not like
the just verdicts of private judges.

00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:02.432
It is often asserted that we need
this “arbiter of last resort”

00:47:02.432 --> 00:47:05.779
with monopoly power over all
other judges for justice to be served.

00:47:05.779 --> 00:47:08.580
But the exact opposite is the case.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.240
The more independent judges are in applying
their judgement to some case,

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.459
the better off we are.

00:47:13.459 --> 00:47:17.214
On the one hand, the capitalist judge is
at the very least <i>trying</i>

00:47:17.214 --> 00:47:20.690
to do justice in some specific
case he has before him,

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.711
and on the other, the monopoly judiciary
must necessarily

00:47:23.711 --> 00:47:26.586
tend towards a systematic perversion of justice

00:47:26.586 --> 00:47:28.791
by the fact that it is a monopoly.

00:47:28.791 --> 00:47:30.937
Law is not subjective or intrinsic,

00:47:30.937 --> 00:47:32.713
it cannot be decreed from on high

00:47:32.713 --> 00:47:35.543
by the standard of
“he’s the guy with the biggest gavel.”

00:47:35.543 --> 00:47:37.906
Objective legal principles can be applied

00:47:37.906 --> 00:47:41.420
<i>only</i> when rational men are able
to use their rational judgement

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.707
to do justice without the razor of Damocles

00:47:43.707 --> 00:47:46.978
that is an arbiter of last resort
constantly undercutting them.

00:47:46.978 --> 00:47:49.137
One final point must be addressed here

00:47:49.137 --> 00:47:52.291
before the positive case for private
defense insurance is complete:

00:47:52.291 --> 00:47:54.779
namely, in a capitalist society,

00:47:54.779 --> 00:47:57.118
what methods could free peoples utilise

00:47:57.118 --> 00:47:59.996
in order to defend themselves
against state aggression?

00:47:59.996 --> 00:48:01.584
First, it is worth questioning

00:48:01.584 --> 00:48:04.511
<i>why</i> a sovereign would wish
to do this in the first place.

00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:06.228
<i>Who</i> would they be invading?

00:48:06.228 --> 00:48:10.479
There is no competing sovereign
or state in this area to direct his attacks towards,

00:48:10.479 --> 00:48:13.380
there are only freely associating people,

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.691
each engaged in their own individual behaviours.

00:48:15.691 --> 00:48:20.843
These free men would tend to have not aggressed
against any citizens in the invading nation,

00:48:20.843 --> 00:48:23.463
and they would tend to have
not provoked any aggressions

00:48:23.463 --> 00:48:26.160
from the invaders for reasons previously stated.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.771
Any individual who was engaged
in such provocation or aggression

00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:32.282
would quickly become
unwelcome in the free society,

00:48:32.282 --> 00:48:36.560
forced to live on the outskirts where the state may
simply arrest him without needing to invade.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.554
Furthermore, options for casus belli
become quite limited

00:48:39.554 --> 00:48:42.617
without a single collective state
to pin grievances onto.

00:48:42.617 --> 00:48:45.227
Any state must in some way justify its conduct

00:48:45.227 --> 00:48:47.132
to the men who would be carrying out its crimes,

00:48:47.132 --> 00:48:49.280
the justification needn’t be good,

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.482
but it needs to exist.

00:48:50.482 --> 00:48:53.560
There would be no terrorist attacks
coming from the free people,

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.511
the free people would not be seeking

00:48:54.511 --> 00:48:56.840
any expansionist wars against
neighboring territories,

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.849
and they would be engaged in
no internal ethnic cleansings

00:48:59.849 --> 00:49:03.908
or other such “crimes against humanity”
to be used as a justification for attack.

00:49:03.908 --> 00:49:07.273
It would be quite the risk indeed for
any sovereign to show their hand

00:49:07.273 --> 00:49:10.256
by attempting to wipe out clearly
innocent and peaceful men;

00:49:10.256 --> 00:49:13.153
far easier to stick to standard inter-state conflict.

00:49:13.153 --> 00:49:17.243
Indeed, the wars fought by
the predominant empire, the United States,

00:49:17.243 --> 00:49:18.804
are justified on the Hobbesian grounds

00:49:18.804 --> 00:49:21.240
that there must be a single
powerful world sovereign

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.161
who can overwhelm all others.

00:49:23.161 --> 00:49:26.291
But these attacks are pointed,
then, at other sovereigns,

00:49:26.291 --> 00:49:29.261
rather than random businessmen and industrialists

00:49:29.261 --> 00:49:32.728
who do not represent any contest
in the ruling of subjects.

00:49:32.728 --> 00:49:36.599
However, let’s say that a state
does find such a cause for invasion

00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:38.799
–perhaps justified on the grounds that the capitalists

00:49:38.799 --> 00:49:40.278
are selfishly hogging wealth

00:49:40.278 --> 00:49:42.181
and exploiting the workers of the world

00:49:42.181 --> 00:49:44.868
–how could the state expect
to win in such a conflict?

00:49:44.868 --> 00:49:49.207
Recall that the state in its capacity as a
monopolistic expropriator of wealth

00:49:49.207 --> 00:49:52.456
tends to provide lower quality
and less efficient services;

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:57.374
thus the free capitalists would be in
a far superior fighting position per dollar spent.

00:49:57.374 --> 00:50:00.892
Any invading state would face
not disarmed civilians

00:50:00.892 --> 00:50:02.960
who rely upon a central power to protect them,

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.788
but the most well-armed population
ever seen on planet Earth.

00:50:06.788 --> 00:50:08.890
Each individual would be capable

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.310
of neutralising scores of enemy combatants

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:12.579
at the flick of his wrist.

00:50:12.579 --> 00:50:15.141
If the biggest military ever failed to win a war

00:50:15.141 --> 00:50:17.480
against a bunch of rice farmers
living under communism,

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.462
how would any state stand even
the slightest chance

00:50:20.462 --> 00:50:25.800
against hyper-industry incentivised
to immediately deal with any threats that face it,

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.730
and with the means to do so?

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:28.569
The Randian war-hawks have it

00:50:28.569 --> 00:50:31.466
that examples such as Vietnam
and the various Middle Eastern wars

00:50:31.466 --> 00:50:33.783
do not demonstrate that America is impotent

00:50:33.783 --> 00:50:35.955
as a matter of economic necessity,

00:50:35.955 --> 00:50:38.731
but rather that the American government
is impotent by choice.

00:50:38.731 --> 00:50:39.788
Peikoff has it that

00:50:39.788 --> 00:50:42.493
if America would utterly destroy
the Iranian government,

00:50:42.493 --> 00:50:45.999
up to and including the glassing of
the entire territory with nuclear weapons,

00:50:45.999 --> 00:50:48.886
that then the military goals of
the US are achievable.

00:50:48.886 --> 00:50:51.191
The assertion is that the US operates

00:50:51.191 --> 00:50:53.664
as a paper tiger with respect to these regions,

00:50:53.664 --> 00:50:56.869
wearing kiddy gloves and refusing
to use its full might

00:50:56.869 --> 00:51:01.179
—and that this is why it constantly fails at
these military objectives against guerillas.

00:51:01.179 --> 00:51:02.647
So doc, do I understand that

00:51:02.647 --> 00:51:06.270
if the US does go in with heavy duty air power

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:07.992
and all kinds of things like this

00:51:07.992 --> 00:51:09.239
and civilians get killed,

00:51:09.239 --> 00:51:11.196
you're not so worried about that?

00:51:11.196 --> 00:51:14.902
I'm absolutely not concerned with innocence.

00:51:14.902 --> 00:51:17.358
People in the enemy territory,

00:51:17.358 --> 00:51:19.447
if they get killed

00:51:19.447 --> 00:51:21.817
that is the responsibility of their government

00:51:21.817 --> 00:51:24.265
for initiating aggression against us.

00:51:24.265 --> 00:51:27.615
In any war, when you fight the enemy,

00:51:27.615 --> 00:51:30.435
you have to take anyone in that territory

00:51:30.435 --> 00:51:32.750
and regard him as part of the enemy.

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:35.234
Otherwise, you can't defend yourself.

00:51:35.234 --> 00:51:38.430
I'm not saying you have to use nuclear weapons,

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:40.659
I'm saying we have a moral right

00:51:40.659 --> 00:51:43.379
to use nuclear or any other weapons

00:51:43.379 --> 00:51:47.273
that is considered by the military
the most effective.

00:51:47.273 --> 00:51:50.878
I'm not... I'm a civilian,
I don't recommend strategy,

00:51:50.878 --> 00:51:52.700
I say to the military this:

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:56.115
you have a moral right and a moral obligation

00:51:56.115 --> 00:51:58.361
to decide what course of battle

00:51:58.361 --> 00:52:01.107
is going to achieve a decisive American victory,

00:52:01.107 --> 00:52:02.655
as fast as possible,

00:52:02.655 --> 00:52:04.851
with the fewest American casualties.

00:52:04.851 --> 00:52:07.377
You decide because only you the military know

00:52:07.377 --> 00:52:09.700
what the cost of those weapons are,

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.687
what the effects of spreading radiation etc.

00:52:11.687 --> 00:52:12.279
-You can't...

00:52:12.279 --> 00:52:15.299
Putting aside the total moral
abhorrence and collectivism

00:52:15.299 --> 00:52:17.500
inherent in these arguments about using force

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:20.559
against civilians in so-called “enemy territories,”

00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:22.610
it strikes me that this “paper tiger” claim

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.609
is completely at odds with
the example of the Vietnam war.

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:29.893
The US military would routinely shell
mountain-sides with long-range artillery,

00:52:29.893 --> 00:52:32.640
burn down entire jungles with napalm strikes,

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.752
and spray chemical agents
over vast swathes of land.

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:41.740
In fact, the US military dropped more than double
the <i>entire</i> yield of all explosives used in WW2

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.690
<i>including</i> the atom bombs

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:44.452
during the Vietnam war.

00:52:44.452 --> 00:52:46.510
All of this and they <i>still</i>

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:48.188
didn’t take out some commie rice farmers.

00:52:48.188 --> 00:52:51.571
This hardly strikes me as what
a “paper tiger” would do,

00:52:51.571 --> 00:52:54.134
and certainly points to the fact
that guerilla strategies

00:52:54.134 --> 00:52:58.107
are simply massively successful
against giant collectivist militaries.

00:52:58.107 --> 00:53:01.310
Furthermore, if we assume that we
have an established free region,

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:03.223
rather than commie rice farmers,

00:53:03.223 --> 00:53:05.985
there would have been in the
preceding however-many-years

00:53:05.985 --> 00:53:09.733
a steady brain drain from statist
countries to the capitalist society.

00:53:09.733 --> 00:53:13.716
The states of the world would find themselves
with an ever-reducing scientific community

00:53:13.716 --> 00:53:16.349
to develop weaponry and
devise methods of attack.

00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:19.109
Insurance firms would also surely recognise

00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:21.866
the acute threat posed by any neighboring state

00:53:21.866 --> 00:53:24.814
and would as such charge
higher insurance premiums

00:53:24.814 --> 00:53:27.701
from areas likely to be the target of invasion.

00:53:27.701 --> 00:53:30.163
These higher premiums would have to be justified

00:53:30.163 --> 00:53:34.285
by a demonstrable improvement
to defensive instalments in these areas.

00:53:34.285 --> 00:53:36.924
Any insurance firm that hopes to stay in business

00:53:36.924 --> 00:53:39.760
would have to keep track of
statist military movements

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.606
and capabilities through
advanced intelligence services,

00:53:42.606 --> 00:53:44.920
and would have to be capable
and prepared to overwhelm

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.225
any force that arrives

00:53:46.225 --> 00:53:48.316
through sufficient equipment and training.

00:53:48.316 --> 00:53:51.714
Any statist invaders would face
long-range precision weaponry

00:53:51.714 --> 00:53:55.563
that had only been dreamed about
in the minds of science fiction authors.

00:53:55.563 --> 00:53:58.360
It would be very challenging to muster
the morale required

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.714
to send archers and stone-throwers to invade

00:54:00.714 --> 00:54:03.872
a sophisticated multi-domain
and highly-adaptive power.

00:54:03.872 --> 00:54:07.361
Insurance firms could also engage
in offensive surgical strikes

00:54:07.361 --> 00:54:08.967
against key state opponents.

00:54:08.967 --> 00:54:11.151
Any warmongerer could be efficiently dispatched

00:54:11.151 --> 00:54:13.891
by stealthy assassins or orbital strikes.

00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:17.313
These offensive capabilities would
minimise collateral damage,

00:54:17.313 --> 00:54:19.924
yielding minimal resistance from state subjects

00:54:19.924 --> 00:54:22.333
—those subjects could be further imbibed

00:54:22.333 --> 00:54:24.421
with constant and effective propaganda

00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:27.160
about how much better life is under capitalism.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.165
Any attempted invasion against the capitalists

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:31.170
would very quickly yield a decisive response

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:33.963
from basically every insurance agency in the area;

00:54:33.963 --> 00:54:35.283
and perhaps others abroad

00:54:35.283 --> 00:54:37.696
who wish to discourage war against free people.

00:54:37.696 --> 00:54:39.427
These invasions could thus very well

00:54:39.427 --> 00:54:41.839
spell the end of any regime who attempts them,

00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:43.878
leaving way for all-too-eager coups

00:54:43.878 --> 00:54:45.864
whose progenitors promise to not invoke

00:54:45.864 --> 00:54:49.278
the wrath of their military
and intellectual superiors.

00:54:49.278 --> 00:54:51.456
So, if free market defensive services

00:54:51.456 --> 00:54:53.661
are so superior to the statist offerings,

00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:55.301
why have they not arrived?

00:54:55.301 --> 00:54:56.650
The answer, in short,

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:59.435
is that the philosophy of the day
does not allow for it.

00:54:59.435 --> 00:55:02.338
I will be making a detailed video
on the philosophy of history

00:55:02.338 --> 00:55:04.920
that will more-fully explain this point in the future

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.238
–and in fact the original version of this script

00:55:07.238 --> 00:55:08.692
contained such an explanation

00:55:08.692 --> 00:55:11.642
–but for now I must remain brief
in giving an explanation

00:55:11.642 --> 00:55:14.297
of Leonard Peikoff’s philosophical theory of history.

00:55:14.297 --> 00:55:16.330
The basic premise underlying this idea

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:18.850
is that man has free will,

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:21.768
and as such the type of society which
obtains at any point in history

00:55:21.768 --> 00:55:25.223
must be the result of the choices
made by the men who live in it.

00:55:25.223 --> 00:55:27.294
Fundamentally, the choices men make

00:55:27.294 --> 00:55:29.474
will be influenced by the philosophy they hold

00:55:29.474 --> 00:55:32.467
—if a man believes that knowledge
can be gained only by appealing

00:55:32.467 --> 00:55:34.667
to the mystic divinations of temple priests

00:55:34.667 --> 00:55:36.450
or Keynesian economists

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:38.498
then he will find himself weak and dependent.

00:55:38.498 --> 00:55:40.577
If the philosophy of the day teaches man

00:55:40.577 --> 00:55:43.499
that his only moral worth
can be found in doing his duty

00:55:43.499 --> 00:55:45.890
and that this demands he not live for himself,

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:47.939
then he will be primed to obey the orders

00:55:47.939 --> 00:55:49.843
of any tyrant who comes along.

00:55:49.843 --> 00:55:52.122
This is the key insight for our topic here.

00:55:52.122 --> 00:55:54.430
If men broadly accept a philosophy

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:55.937
that implies a statist politics,

00:55:55.937 --> 00:55:58.536
this will practically result in the average man

00:55:58.536 --> 00:56:01.414
having less and less control over his own life,

00:56:01.414 --> 00:56:04.350
and more and more dependence
upon the government.

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:05.904
Through every inevitable crisis

00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:07.720
that results from such a system,

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.728
the man will feel ever less in control

00:56:09.728 --> 00:56:11.839
and ever less able to shape his own life

00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:13.640
and achieve wellbeing,

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.409
and he will be accordingly driven
deeper into the well of dependence

00:56:16.409 --> 00:56:17.843
upon the ones who rule him.

00:56:17.843 --> 00:56:21.599
All the while the intellectuals spend
their time degrading the individual,

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:23.417
telling him that his mind is helpless,

00:56:23.417 --> 00:56:24.799
he cannot know anything,

00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:26.226
thought is untrustworthy,

00:56:26.226 --> 00:56:27.277
there are no answers,

00:56:27.277 --> 00:56:28.539
there are no absolutes,

00:56:28.539 --> 00:56:30.010
that he must share his wealth,

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:31.285
that his race is evil,

00:56:31.285 --> 00:56:35.903
and that his only goal in life should be to see how
fully he can destroy himself for the collective.

00:56:35.903 --> 00:56:39.693
Fundamentally, the state makes up
a tiny fraction of the population

00:56:39.693 --> 00:56:42.559
—they cannot control men by brute force.

00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:46.601
The sovereign counts on men to follow
an anti-individual philosophy,

00:56:46.601 --> 00:56:48.362
such that they will cheer with glee

00:56:48.362 --> 00:56:50.221
as everything good is destroyed.

00:56:50.221 --> 00:56:52.589
A philosophy that would shape a free society

00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:54.897
would have men thinking for themselves,

00:56:54.897 --> 00:56:56.296
acting independently,

00:56:56.296 --> 00:56:57.756
working for their own sake

00:56:57.756 --> 00:56:59.336
and for their own happiness.

00:56:59.336 --> 00:57:01.573
If this is the philosophy that men accept

00:57:01.573 --> 00:57:04.717
then it would become the standard
that everyone would expect

00:57:04.717 --> 00:57:08.600
—and as such these would be
the standards adopted by institutions

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.931
and those that men would learn to follow.

00:57:10.931 --> 00:57:14.143
For there to be a society that
accepts anarcho-capitalism

00:57:14.143 --> 00:57:16.770
and operates on the terms set by private property,

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:18.741
there must first be a rational,

00:57:18.741 --> 00:57:21.982
this-worldly philosophy accepted by the masses.

00:57:21.982 --> 00:57:23.100
There must first be

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.244
an acceptance of Objectivism.

00:57:25.244 --> 00:57:28.340
Thus I may now turn my attention
towards my aforementioned

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.469
integration of anarcho-capitalism
with Objectivism.

00:57:31.469 --> 00:57:35.406
In my view, Objectivism is the only
proper philosophical basis

00:57:35.406 --> 00:57:37.599
for the anarcho-capitalist legal theory,

00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:39.485
and the anarcho-capitalist legal theory

00:57:39.485 --> 00:57:42.792
is the only proper legal theory
on Objectivist philosophy.

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:46.521
First, the need to have a sound philosophy
for a sound legal theory

00:57:46.521 --> 00:57:50.315
comes from the fact that law is
a highly remote area of philosophy.

00:57:50.315 --> 00:57:53.589
Law is the subset of ethics
which specifically tells man

00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:55.987
what he should do with respect to conflicts

00:57:55.987 --> 00:57:57.475
—should they be avoided or not?

00:57:57.475 --> 00:57:59.049
When should they be avoided or not?

00:57:59.049 --> 00:58:00.822
Are they ethically relevant or not?

00:58:00.822 --> 00:58:02.943
This is the area that law tackles

00:58:02.943 --> 00:58:06.536
and it obviously depends in
the first case on ethics itself.

00:58:06.536 --> 00:58:08.599
If there are no ethical truths,

00:58:08.599 --> 00:58:10.960
then there cannot be legal truths either,

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:14.600
and we are forced to retreat
into subjectivism or relativism.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.958
If there are ethical truths

00:58:15.958 --> 00:58:18.551
but they are intrinsic and come
from the mystical dictate

00:58:18.551 --> 00:58:19.961
of a king or God,

00:58:19.961 --> 00:58:24.479
this will clearly lead to a legal philosophy
which holds law as being intrinsic also.

00:58:24.479 --> 00:58:25.420
This has happened

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.420
–and still happens

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.877
–in the real world application
of law to specific disputes.

00:58:29.877 --> 00:58:31.520
During the Salem witch trials

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.348
it was not uncommon to have
testimony reach the court

00:58:34.348 --> 00:58:37.735
alleging that someone had committed
a spiritual attack against a person.

00:58:37.735 --> 00:58:40.922
The accusers claim was taken
as so-called “spectral evidence”

00:58:40.922 --> 00:58:43.550
that this attack had actually occurred.

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:47.640
Spectral evidence refers to a witness testimony

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.793
that the accused person’s spirit or spectral shape

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:53.489
appeared to [the] witness in a dream

00:58:53.489 --> 00:58:58.478
at the time the accused person’s
physical body was at another location.

00:58:58.478 --> 00:59:03.210
It was accepted in the courts
during the Salem Witch Trials.

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:05.430
The evidence was accepted on the basis

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:11.455
that the devil and his minions were powerful
enough to send their spirits, or specters,

00:59:11.455 --> 00:59:13.669
to pure, religious people

00:59:13.669 --> 00:59:16.220
in order to lead them astray.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:20.117
In spectral evidence,
the admission of victims’ conjectures

00:59:20.117 --> 00:59:24.597
is governed only by the limits
of their fears and imaginations,

00:59:24.597 --> 00:59:29.404
whether or not objectively proven
facts are forthcoming to justify them.

00:59:29.404 --> 00:59:34.684
This legal principle comes directly from the
supernaturalistic metaphysics of the Puritans:

00:59:34.684 --> 00:59:40.559
The Puritans believed that physical
realities had spiritual causes.

00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:42.836
For example, if the crop failed,

00:59:42.836 --> 00:59:45.290
the Devil may have played a role

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:50.079
—and Satan could not take
the form of an unwilling person.

00:59:50.079 --> 00:59:53.716
So if anyone claimed to have
seen a ghost or spirit

00:59:53.716 --> 00:59:55.667
in the form of the accused,

00:59:55.667 --> 00:59:58.706
that person must be a witch.

00:59:58.706 --> 01:00:01.693
With this worldview, it was not a stretch

01:00:01.693 --> 01:00:05.480
for Puritans to believe in spectral evidence,

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.419
which was the primary evidence
used as proof of guilt.

01:00:09.419 --> 01:00:11.727
With a false philosophy as the grounding,

01:00:11.727 --> 01:00:13.594
even the most sound legal theory

01:00:13.594 --> 01:00:16.280
cannot properly map onto reality.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.510
After all, one can imagine
that even if the Puritans

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:21.720
accepted wholeheartedly
the non-aggression principle,

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.623
they could simply hold that these spectral attacks

01:00:23.623 --> 01:00:25.944
initiate conflict and are thus illicit.

01:00:25.944 --> 01:00:30.290
Perhaps the Marxian completely agrees with
any argument one might come forth with

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:33.159
that the only proper legal principle
is non-aggression,

01:00:33.159 --> 01:00:37.234
but claim that this applies only
to the bourgeoisie with their bourgeois logic

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:40.200
—if we were so-conditioned to
accept proletarian logic,

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.231
we would understand that individual
property rights are illusory

01:00:43.231 --> 01:00:46.953
and that the proper meaning of liberty
involves total obedience to the collective.

01:00:46.953 --> 01:00:50.549
So anarcho-capitalism requires Objectivism.

01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:55.890
Now, before elaborating on why Objectivism
properly understood yields anarcho-capitalism,

01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:58.661
it is worth going over the case Rand gives for her

01:00:58.661 --> 01:01:01.317
–decidedly not anarchistic–politics.

01:01:01.317 --> 01:01:04.359
Before I can give a proper case
for politics as Rand sees it,

01:01:04.359 --> 01:01:07.307
I must establish a more
fundamental ethical principle,

01:01:07.307 --> 01:01:09.290
which I agree with Rand on:

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:12.185
namely that the initiation
of force is a moral evil.

01:01:12.185 --> 01:01:15.319
The justification of this principle
on Objectivist grounds

01:01:15.319 --> 01:01:17.826
is that the mind cannot work under compulsion

01:01:17.826 --> 01:01:20.247
—in order to make a man act against his judgement

01:01:20.247 --> 01:01:21.964
you must nullify his judgement.

01:01:21.964 --> 01:01:24.283
This is what is meant by the use of force.

01:01:24.283 --> 01:01:26.610
There would be no reason to force a man

01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:27.815
to do what he was already planning to do

01:01:27.815 --> 01:01:29.908
—insofar as you are actually forcing him,

01:01:29.908 --> 01:01:33.538
you must be making him act
<i>against</i> his own rational judgement,

01:01:33.538 --> 01:01:36.682
i.e. you are making him act
as his own destroyer.

01:01:36.682 --> 01:01:38.932
What this means is that force and value

01:01:38.932 --> 01:01:41.210
are entirely opposed to each other

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:43.123
—you can have either one or the other.

01:01:43.123 --> 01:01:45.473
This is a perspective unique to Objectivism

01:01:45.473 --> 01:01:47.159
within the history of philosophy

01:01:47.159 --> 01:01:48.743
—the two main opposing schools,

01:01:48.743 --> 01:01:50.583
intrinsicism and subjectivism,

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:52.553
both reject it in their own way.

01:01:52.553 --> 01:01:54.565
The intrinsic school holds that values

01:01:54.565 --> 01:01:56.796
have nothing to do with a man’s perception,

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:59.230
his evaluation, or the context of his life.

01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:02.960
On this view “value” is an intrinsic
attribute of something,

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.654
knowledge of which is derived
through mystic means.

01:02:05.654 --> 01:02:07.650
Therefore, they say,

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:08.623
values can be forced upon a man

01:02:08.623 --> 01:02:11.401
against his own judgement
and “for his own good”

01:02:11.401 --> 01:02:13.869
—because value has nothing to do
with his judgement,

01:02:13.869 --> 01:02:16.338
even forcing him to act
against his judgement

01:02:16.338 --> 01:02:17.749
can be a value to him.

01:02:17.749 --> 01:02:20.821
You can achieve the good for
someone else at the point of a gun.

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:24.583
The subjectivists take the other side of
the mind-body false-dichotomy

01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:26.344
but arrive at the same conclusion.

01:02:26.344 --> 01:02:30.317
On subjectivism, something is a value
if one merely claims it to be,

01:02:30.317 --> 01:02:32.505
as “value” is a mere arbitrary name

01:02:32.505 --> 01:02:34.429
that tells us nothing about the world,

01:02:34.429 --> 01:02:37.690
only giving insight into
a so-called relation of ideas.

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:40.369
Because there are no objective
values on this viewpoint,

01:02:40.369 --> 01:02:42.812
a value can be whatever a man claims it to be.

01:02:42.812 --> 01:02:44.148
If a man feels that he is right

01:02:44.148 --> 01:02:46.151
in robbing or beating his fellow men,

01:02:46.151 --> 01:02:47.980
then he is

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.998
—if he feels that something is good,

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:49.850
then it is.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:52.264
Given subjective feelings are the standard,

01:02:52.264 --> 01:02:54.593
one could not possibly hope to convince others

01:02:54.593 --> 01:02:57.427
of a moral view through rational argumentation

01:02:57.427 --> 01:02:59.670
—thus the only remaining option

01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:01.870
is to force others to obey
your arbitrary whims.

01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:06.941
The error of both schools is found in their
attempted separation of values from the mind

01:03:06.941 --> 01:03:09.857
—that values are whatever is
in accord with gods plan,

01:03:09.857 --> 01:03:11.283
irrespective of judgement;

01:03:11.283 --> 01:03:13.400
or that values are based on arbitrary whim

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.748
completely divorced from
the faculty that judges.

01:03:15.748 --> 01:03:18.823
Neither school recognises
that a value is a value

01:03:18.823 --> 01:03:20.912
<i>as evaluated by a thinking mind</i>

01:03:20.912 --> 01:03:23.350
<i>through the application of a rational standard.</i>

01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:26.964
Values cannot exist without a mind
there to do the evaluating,

01:03:26.964 --> 01:03:29.310
namely, a man’s <i>own</i> mind.

01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:31.443
Just as others cannot digest food for you,

01:03:31.443 --> 01:03:34.244
so too can they not think or evaluate for you.

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.634
The brute exists as a parasite.

01:03:36.634 --> 01:03:38.627
He does not produce values himself,

01:03:38.627 --> 01:03:41.120
rather his survival depends
on the values produced

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.839
by those whom he predates upon.

01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:45.433
They undercut themselves in this activity

01:03:45.433 --> 01:03:47.222
—they are attacking and destroying

01:03:47.222 --> 01:03:49.641
the very root of their own sustenance.

01:03:49.641 --> 01:03:52.285
They rely on the universe to make A non-A,

01:03:52.285 --> 01:03:54.213
to yield an effect without the cause,

01:03:54.213 --> 01:03:56.452
to conform to their wishes.

01:03:56.452 --> 01:03:57.974
Now that it has been established

01:03:57.974 --> 01:04:00.293
that force and value are incompatible,

01:04:00.293 --> 01:04:03.681
we can move into the territory
of the Randian politics proper.

01:04:03.681 --> 01:04:06.760
So, the case is something like the following:

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.989
if man is to live he requires
a code of values to guide his actions

01:04:09.989 --> 01:04:14.515
—living in a society is such a value to man
if it is the right <i>kind</i> of society.

01:04:14.515 --> 01:04:16.357
Politics is the branch of philosophy

01:04:16.357 --> 01:04:17.743
that seeks to define the principles

01:04:17.743 --> 01:04:19.125
that must undergird a society

01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:21.103
if it is to be a value to man

01:04:21.103 --> 01:04:23.996
—that is, the principles of a moral society.

01:04:23.996 --> 01:04:26.713
First it must be noted that the individual

01:04:26.713 --> 01:04:29.361
is the unit of reality
and the standard of value.

01:04:29.361 --> 01:04:32.310
That is, society is a derivative concept

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:34.189
that has no existence unto itself

01:04:34.189 --> 01:04:36.989
—a group is a group <i>of individuals</i>,

01:04:36.989 --> 01:04:38.885
rather than the other way around.

01:04:38.885 --> 01:04:42.413
This means that any politics
that seeks to proceed in its analysis

01:04:42.413 --> 01:04:44.797
by concerning itself with “the good of the many”

01:04:44.797 --> 01:04:46.100
or any other such notion

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.410
must be completely discarded on its face.

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.235
The most basic principle in politics

01:04:50.235 --> 01:04:52.887
is inalienable, individual rights.

01:04:52.887 --> 01:04:54.717
Our preceding analysis makes clear

01:04:54.717 --> 01:04:56.752
why it is that rights must be individual:

01:04:56.752 --> 01:04:59.810
the individual is the basic political unit

01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:02.208
and so the theory of rights
must be a theory of <i>individual</i> rights

01:05:02.208 --> 01:05:04.183
if it is to be considered rational.

01:05:04.183 --> 01:05:06.660
The rights must be inalienable

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:07.923
because the alternative is not a right,

01:05:07.923 --> 01:05:08.997
but a permission

01:05:08.997 --> 01:05:12.490
—if my rights are subject to
the arbitrary decrees of some king,

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:13.904
or duke, or other such figure,

01:05:13.904 --> 01:05:17.599
then I must receive <i>permission</i> from him
to engage in some activity.

01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:19.143
This is the key insight here:

01:05:19.143 --> 01:05:21.890
a right can only mean a principle

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:23.099
that defends the individual from others

01:05:23.099 --> 01:05:25.273
—this is accordingly a theory of <i>negative</i>,

01:05:25.273 --> 01:05:27.210
not <i>positive</i> rights.

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:31.283
A so-called positive right would be
something like my having a right to healthcare.

01:05:31.283 --> 01:05:32.484
Such a theory of rights

01:05:32.484 --> 01:05:34.335
is faced with an immediate contradiction:

01:05:34.335 --> 01:05:36.947
if I have a right to receive
the services of doctors

01:05:36.947 --> 01:05:38.632
no matter what they want to do,

01:05:38.632 --> 01:05:42.136
then those doctors must no longer have
the right to live their own life.

01:05:42.136 --> 01:05:45.319
Force must be used against
the doctors to make them comply,

01:05:45.319 --> 01:05:46.489
but as explained above

01:05:46.489 --> 01:05:49.410
this means nullifying the doctors’
basic means of survival:

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:50.657
their minds.

01:05:50.657 --> 01:05:54.141
That is, if I demand this
treatment and should get it,

01:05:54.141 --> 01:05:56.573
then they no longer have the right to live;

01:05:56.573 --> 01:05:58.465
if I demand it and should not get it,

01:05:58.465 --> 01:06:00.909
then I no longer have the right to their labour

01:06:00.909 --> 01:06:02.755
—the two are mutually-exclusive.

01:06:02.755 --> 01:06:05.690
Accordingly, Rand defined a right as

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:10.194
“a moral principle defining and sanctioning
a man’s freedom of action in a social context.”

01:06:10.194 --> 01:06:12.124
A right is a <i>moral</i> principle

01:06:12.124 --> 01:06:15.664
because it stands as the precondition
for a society to be a value to man;

01:06:15.664 --> 01:06:18.445
it defines and sanctions man's “freedom of action”

01:06:18.445 --> 01:06:20.703
because it is and must be negative;

01:06:20.703 --> 01:06:22.714
it does so in a social context

01:06:22.714 --> 01:06:25.166
because there is no society
to protect man from

01:06:25.166 --> 01:06:26.806
without said context.

01:06:26.806 --> 01:06:29.591
Now that I have elucidated
the Objectivist politics

01:06:29.591 --> 01:06:30.944
–at least briefly–

01:06:30.944 --> 01:06:32.857
I must turn to my dispute with it,

01:06:32.857 --> 01:06:36.434
which impinges upon a great schism
within the Objectivist movement:

01:06:36.434 --> 01:06:38.970
namely, the debate over

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:41.213
whether Objectivism is
an open or closed system.

01:06:41.213 --> 01:06:43.303
If Objectivism is a closed system,

01:06:43.303 --> 01:06:45.689
that is, if it is just whatever beliefs

01:06:45.689 --> 01:06:47.358
in philosophy that Ayn Rand held,

01:06:47.358 --> 01:06:48.787
then it can never develop

01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:50.805
or shift from the moment of her death.

01:06:50.805 --> 01:06:53.749
In this case, the preceding
analysis of Rand’s politics

01:06:53.749 --> 01:06:56.079
<i>is</i> the Objectivist politics.

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:57.400
If, on the other hand,

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.308
Objectivism is an open system,

01:06:59.308 --> 01:07:02.567
then “Ayn Rand said so”
cannot stand as an argument

01:07:02.567 --> 01:07:06.230
for the preceding analysis
being the <i>Objectivist</i> politics.

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.198
Let me first state that I am not
going to give the standard case

01:07:09.198 --> 01:07:10.964
for Objectivism being an open system

01:07:10.964 --> 01:07:12.779
as forwarded by Stephen Hicks.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.560
I think that Craig Biddle gave
an unanswerable objection

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.602
to Hicks’ presentation of open
Objectivism in their debate.

01:07:18.602 --> 01:07:22.670
Namely: Hicks has it that Objectivism
means true philosophy

01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:23.797
—this is a frozen abstraction

01:07:23.797 --> 01:07:25.743
and must therefore be entirely disallowed

01:07:25.743 --> 01:07:27.376
within our conceptual framework.

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:29.380
Objectivism is not a science,

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.332
it is a particular philosophical theory.

01:07:31.332 --> 01:07:32.832
I do want to be clear here

01:07:32.832 --> 01:07:35.186
because this debate often gets fairly heated;

01:07:35.186 --> 01:07:39.430
I hold no animosity or contempt to
anybody in the Atlas Society

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.777
or anybody else who is in the David Kelley
school of open Objectivism.

01:07:42.777 --> 01:07:45.632
I think that they are doing fantastic work
to promote Objectivism

01:07:45.632 --> 01:07:47.359
and they form a great resistance

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:50.359
to some of the more Rand-worshipper
elements of the movement.

01:07:50.359 --> 01:07:52.707
I also am not adopting any sort of a smear

01:07:52.707 --> 01:07:54.573
against the closed Objectivists in claiming

01:07:54.573 --> 01:07:57.884
they are closed minded as
is allegedly done sometimes

01:07:57.884 --> 01:08:00.559
—closed Objectivism in the context of this video

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:03.134
should be taken <i>only</i> to mean that theory

01:08:03.134 --> 01:08:07.450
that Objectivism means whatever
beliefs in philosophy Ayn Rand held.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:10.573
I hold to a different sort of open
Objectivism than that of Kelley or Hicks.

01:08:10.573 --> 01:08:14.920
Namely: I don’t hold that
Objectivism means true philosophy,

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.090
<i>or</i> that it means whatever beliefs
in philosophy were held by Ayn Rand

01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:22.532
—in my view, Objectivism is the philosophy
of the primacy of existence.

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:25.220
The primacy of existence is basically the view

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.785
that existence is the most fundamental fact.

01:08:27.785 --> 01:08:30.752
That <i>first</i> one must have it
that existence exists,

01:08:30.752 --> 01:08:32.194
<i>then</i> one can recognise

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:33.621
that they are conscious of it.

01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:36.960
To explain this view, it is worth
contrasting it with the opposing view

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.704
—the primacy of consciousness.

01:08:38.704 --> 01:08:42.680
One form of this is found in
Descartes’ <i>cogito ergo sum</i>

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.234
—I think, <i>therefore</i> I am.

01:08:44.234 --> 01:08:48.813
The starting point for Descartes is
an “I think,” not an “it is.”

01:08:48.813 --> 01:08:51.439
Another form of it is found in
the religious viewpoint

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:53.213
that reality requires a cause,

01:08:53.213 --> 01:08:56.314
and that this cause must be
the consciousness they call God.

01:08:56.314 --> 01:08:58.410
This is also the primacy of consciousness

01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:01.123
—supernatural thoughts are held
as the fundamental

01:09:01.123 --> 01:09:02.848
which comes before reality.

01:09:02.848 --> 01:09:05.567
If you are interested in why
the primacy of existence is true,

01:09:05.567 --> 01:09:08.318
I refer you to this wiki article
I wrote on the subject.

01:09:08.318 --> 01:09:11.185
Regardless, to justify the claim that Objectivism

01:09:11.185 --> 01:09:13.920
means the philosophy of the primacy of existence,

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.132
let me consult the standard
Objectivist account of definition;

01:09:17.132 --> 01:09:19.498
namely, that a definition is a statement

01:09:19.498 --> 01:09:22.559
that identifies the nature of a concept’s units:

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:25.788
A proper definition is made of two parts,

01:09:25.788 --> 01:09:29.340
each of which follows from
the nature of concept-formation.

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.167
When we form a concept,

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:35.309
we isolate its units by grasping
a distinguishing characteristic.

01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:37.660
In the definition, this becomes

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:40.516
what the medieval Aristotelians
called the differentia.

01:09:40.516 --> 01:09:45.988
Further, we can differentiate only
on the basis of a wider characteristic,

01:09:45.988 --> 01:09:48.490
the [conceptual common-denominator],

01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:51.899
which is shared both by
the concretes we are isolating

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:55.292
and by the concretes from
which we are isolating them.

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:58.342
In the definition, this gives rise to the genus.

01:09:58.342 --> 01:10:01.787
A definition in terms of genus and differentia

01:10:01.787 --> 01:10:04.500
is like a logical X ray of a concept.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:08.251
It condenses into a brief, retainable statement

01:10:08.251 --> 01:10:11.349
the essence of the concept-forming process:

01:10:11.349 --> 01:10:14.431
it tells us what distinguishes the units

01:10:14.431 --> 01:10:16.659
and from what they are being distinguished,

01:10:16.659 --> 01:10:21.493
i.e., within what wider group
the distinction is being made.

01:10:21.493 --> 01:10:23.680
To give the standard example:

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.415
if we conceptualize man
by differentiating men

01:10:27.415 --> 01:10:29.379
from dogs, cats, and horses,

01:10:29.379 --> 01:10:31.838
then “animal” would be the genus

01:10:31.838 --> 01:10:34.661
—“rational,” the differentia.

01:10:34.661 --> 01:10:36.964
So, for my definition, that Objectivism

01:10:36.964 --> 01:10:39.308
is the philosophy of the primacy of existence,

01:10:39.308 --> 01:10:40.374
the <i>genus</i>

01:10:40.374 --> 01:10:41.567
–the common denominator

01:10:41.567 --> 01:10:42.770
–is philosophy.

01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:46.160
Objectivism is a philosophy,
like everything else which is a philosophy.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.287
What makes Objectivism different to all others

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:49.339
–the <i>differentia</i>

01:10:49.339 --> 01:10:52.352
–is that Objectivism explicitly
identifies and applies

01:10:52.352 --> 01:10:55.352
the primacy of existence
to every philosophical issue.

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:58.417
Let me explicate this
with respect to a few areas.

01:10:58.417 --> 01:11:01.417
In metaphysics, the most
fundamental branch of philosophy,

01:11:01.417 --> 01:11:04.516
we have it that according to
Rand’s legal and intellectual heir,

01:11:04.516 --> 01:11:05.385
Leonard Peikoff,

01:11:05.385 --> 01:11:08.504
“[…] the essence of metaphysics […]
is the step-by-step development

01:11:08.504 --> 01:11:10.810
of the corollaries of the existence axiom.”

01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:14.542
So the <i>essence</i> of the <i>Objectivist</i>
approach to metaphysics

01:11:14.542 --> 01:11:16.748
according to its de-facto living leader

01:11:16.748 --> 01:11:19.236
is the development of
the fact that existence exists

01:11:19.236 --> 01:11:21.942
and that it is not subject
to change by thought.

01:11:21.942 --> 01:11:23.779
The basic approach underlying this

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.480
carries on up to the epistemology

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.334
—the philosophy of knowledge.

01:11:27.334 --> 01:11:30.199
What it means to be
<i>objective</i> in epistemology,

01:11:30.199 --> 01:11:31.915
according to standard Objectivism,

01:11:31.915 --> 01:11:33.557
is to appeal to reality.

01:11:33.557 --> 01:11:35.185
It is the recognition of reality.

01:11:35.185 --> 01:11:38.572
This is so because existence
has primacy over consciousness.

01:11:38.572 --> 01:11:41.660
Every single doctrine found
within the Objectivist epistemology

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:43.840
is based on the premise that reality exists

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.994
independently of you,

01:11:44.994 --> 01:11:46.817
and that the role of your consciousness

01:11:46.817 --> 01:11:48.753
is merely to discover facts about it,

01:11:48.753 --> 01:11:50.970
or–if you choose to

01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:51.911
–obscure those facts.

01:11:51.911 --> 01:11:54.353
I could go on, but I think you get the point

01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:56.134
—the <i>essence</i> of Objectivism

01:11:56.134 --> 01:11:59.201
is this consistent application
of the primacy of existence

01:11:59.201 --> 01:12:01.354
to every philosophical issue.

01:12:01.354 --> 01:12:03.619
This is a uniquely Objectivist viewpoint,

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:05.572
and is in fact what Objectivists mean

01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:07.625
when they tell you to be objective

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.710
–the very namesake of the philosophy

01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:14.500
–namely: that objectivity means
adherence to the primacy of existence.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.221
Even Aristotle was not fully
consistent in this approach.

01:12:17.221 --> 01:12:19.114
He failed to explicitly identify

01:12:19.114 --> 01:12:20.931
and apply the primacy of existence

01:12:20.931 --> 01:12:23.183
—the most fundamental
thing in his metaphysics

01:12:23.183 --> 01:12:24.911
is not that existence exists,

01:12:24.911 --> 01:12:28.442
but rather that the Prime Mover
thinks about his own thoughts.

01:12:28.442 --> 01:12:31.309
I have thus satisfied both
requirements of a definition

01:12:31.309 --> 01:12:32.872
on Objectivist grounds

01:12:32.872 --> 01:12:34.700
—I have a genus (philosophy)

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:38.577
and differentia (the explicit application
of the primacy of existence).

01:12:38.577 --> 01:12:41.920
And I do not fall into the same
frozen abstraction objection

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.444
brought forth by Biddle,

01:12:43.444 --> 01:12:46.560
because I am not <i>defining</i>
Objectivism as “true philosophy.”

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.492
To be sure, Objectivism is true philosophy

01:12:49.492 --> 01:12:50.931
<i>on</i> my definition,

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:52.507
but not <i>by</i> definition

01:12:52.507 --> 01:12:55.254
as it is with more primitive
forms of open Objectivism

01:12:55.254 --> 01:12:57.878
—rather, Objectivism is true philosophy

01:12:57.878 --> 01:13:00.398
<i>because the primacy of existence is true.</i>

01:13:00.398 --> 01:13:02.310
So if somehow I were to be convinced

01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:03.848
that the correct approach in, say,

01:13:03.848 --> 01:13:06.770
aesthetics is to appeal
to Platonic forms or something,

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:08.860
I would consider that Platonic aesthetics

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:10.453
to be part of true philosophy,

01:13:10.453 --> 01:13:12.194
but not part of Objectivism.

01:13:12.194 --> 01:13:15.560
The Platonic method would here
be supposedly yielding truth,

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.600
but it would not be adhering
to the unique Objectivist innovation

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.493
which is to explicitly apply
the primacy of existence

01:13:21.493 --> 01:13:23.612
to <i>every</i> philosophical issue.

01:13:23.612 --> 01:13:25.694
This is why my definition is correct,

01:13:25.694 --> 01:13:27.933
as against the innumerable other attempts

01:13:27.933 --> 01:13:29.523
made to define the philosophy.

01:13:29.523 --> 01:13:31.823
For instance, you will hear legion Randians

01:13:31.823 --> 01:13:34.784
attempt to define it as
“the philosophy of Ayn Rand.”

01:13:34.784 --> 01:13:37.313
To be clear: I am not, here, referring to the fact

01:13:37.313 --> 01:13:38.568
that Peikoff’s book is called

01:13:38.568 --> 01:13:40.729
<i>Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand</i>.

01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:42.286
That’s a fine book title.

01:13:42.286 --> 01:13:43.965
I am referring to the numerous people

01:13:43.965 --> 01:13:46.160
I have had legitimately approach the question

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.869
“what is the definition of Objectivism?”

01:13:47.869 --> 01:13:50.364
with “it’s the philosophy
that Ayn Rand came up with.”

01:13:50.364 --> 01:13:52.377
The essence of Objectivism is simply

01:13:52.377 --> 01:13:54.179
not that Ayn Rand discovered it.

01:13:54.179 --> 01:13:55.955
This is a non-definition,

01:13:55.955 --> 01:13:58.520
the Randian has failed
to identify any essential,

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.219
distinguishing, characteristic(s)
of the Objectivist view

01:14:01.219 --> 01:14:02.596
as against any other view.

01:14:02.596 --> 01:14:07.356
Suppose, for instance, that Ayn Rand were to
have gone through some philosophical progression,

01:14:07.356 --> 01:14:09.289
like many other philosophers have.

01:14:09.289 --> 01:14:12.971
Perhaps the early Rand comes up
with Objectivism as we all know and love,

01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:14.287
but then at a later point,

01:14:14.287 --> 01:14:16.120
completely renounces this philosophy

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.780
and comes up with
something entirely different.

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.917
Both of these philosophies would
surely be borne from Rand,

01:14:20.917 --> 01:14:22.571
and yet they are clearly different

01:14:22.571 --> 01:14:24.454
and would require different names.

01:14:24.454 --> 01:14:27.730
We find that the fact that
Rand came up with an idea

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:29.457
is not the <i>essence</i> of that idea.

01:14:29.457 --> 01:14:32.679
The other sort of definition that
the typical Randian will reach for

01:14:32.679 --> 01:14:35.541
consists of listing off the different
branches of philosophy

01:14:35.541 --> 01:14:38.412
and briefly explaining
the Objectivist position on each.

01:14:38.412 --> 01:14:41.851
Again, this is not the proper way
to construct a definition.

01:14:41.851 --> 01:14:43.577
Nowhere else do we define something

01:14:43.577 --> 01:14:46.108
by listing off a number
of attributes that it has.

01:14:46.108 --> 01:14:47.921
Man is the rational animal,

01:14:47.921 --> 01:14:51.210
not the animal that is in the genus
homo with two arms and two legs,

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:52.245
and ears and a nose,

01:14:52.245 --> 01:14:53.514
and mostly hairless skin

01:14:53.514 --> 01:14:54.837
with a certain amount of collagen

01:14:54.837 --> 01:14:56.883
and melanin and so on and so forth.

01:14:56.883 --> 01:14:59.985
Similarly, Objectivism is not
<i>defined</i> as the philosophy

01:14:59.985 --> 01:15:01.704
that says such and such on metaphysics,

01:15:01.704 --> 01:15:03.545
and here is this other thing on epistemology,

01:15:03.545 --> 01:15:05.140
and also here’s the aesthetic theory,

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:08.490
and this meta-ethical viewpoint
and so on and so forth.

01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:12.100
Objectivism is the philosophy
of the primacy of existence.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:15.400
When we are looking for a
definition of a <i>philosophy</i>,

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.777
we are looking for what is
distinctive to that philosophy,

01:15:18.777 --> 01:15:21.537
and thus how it approaches
each of the branches.

01:15:21.537 --> 01:15:23.807
No abstraction can be properly defined

01:15:23.807 --> 01:15:27.281
by listing off each and every
particular to which it applies

01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:29.900
—that is the nominalist approach to definition.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:31.958
So Objectivism as a philosophy

01:15:31.958 --> 01:15:35.423
which is the broader abstraction
beyond each individual branch

01:15:35.423 --> 01:15:39.614
is not defined in terms of listing off
what it says on each branch.

01:15:39.614 --> 01:15:43.291
This sort of listing-definition is
borne from a parrotting of Rand.

01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:45.525
These Randians will watch
an Ayn Rand interview

01:15:45.525 --> 01:15:48.960
where she is asked to <i>explain</i> Objectivism,

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.485
and will see that she goes over
each of the branches

01:15:50.485 --> 01:15:53.423
giving a brief overview of
the Objectivist position on them.

01:15:53.423 --> 01:15:55.431
“Explain” is the key word here.

01:15:55.431 --> 01:15:58.837
Ayn Rand is not defining Objectivism
in terms of the branches,

01:15:58.837 --> 01:16:01.320
she is trying to explain what it means

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.644
in language that will
be understood by the layman.

01:16:03.644 --> 01:16:06.115
A layman will not understand
what it means to say

01:16:06.115 --> 01:16:09.366
that Objectivism is the philosophy
of the primacy of existence,

01:16:09.366 --> 01:16:12.961
they have a far better chance
at understanding what she is getting across

01:16:12.961 --> 01:16:14.402
if she gives an explanation,

01:16:14.402 --> 01:16:15.994
rather than a definition.

01:16:15.994 --> 01:16:18.552
It is also not at all idiosyncratic of me

01:16:18.552 --> 01:16:21.892
to separate the philosophy from
the philosopher who originated it.

01:16:21.892 --> 01:16:24.670
The arch-closed-Objectivist,
Leonard Peikoff,

01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:27.247
does this very thing
with respect to Aristotle.

01:16:27.247 --> 01:16:29.545
Peikoff tells us in his history of philosophy

01:16:29.545 --> 01:16:31.940
that Aristotle the man

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:34.136
had both Platonist and
Aristotelian elements within him.

01:16:34.136 --> 01:16:36.192
This simply could not be the case

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:39.767
if Aristotelian meant whatever
beliefs in philosophy Aristotle held,

01:16:39.767 --> 01:16:42.886
much like the closed Objectivists
want to have for Rand.

01:16:42.886 --> 01:16:45.770
Indeed, Peikoff is entirely correct
to conceptually separate

01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:48.205
the <i>essential</i> approach
that Aristotle performed

01:16:48.205 --> 01:16:50.927
from whatever remote
deviations he may have had.

01:16:50.927 --> 01:16:53.447
As far as the history of
philosophy is concerned,

01:16:53.447 --> 01:16:56.166
any such deviation
is simply irrelevant,

01:16:56.166 --> 01:16:57.613
and will quickly be ironed out

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.799
by more consistent students
of the philosopher

01:16:59.799 --> 01:17:01.200
who did the deviation.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.685
What matters in the
definition of philosophies

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:05.777
is an identification of their essence

01:17:05.777 --> 01:17:08.696
—and that essence has nothing
to do, conceptually speaking,

01:17:08.696 --> 01:17:11.584
with the person who discovered
or invented the philosophy.

01:17:11.584 --> 01:17:13.985
Indeed, Rand herself rejected the term “Randism”

01:17:13.985 --> 01:17:15.660
as a description of her philosophy,

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.219
correcting Mike Wallace
that she calls it Objectivism

01:17:18.219 --> 01:17:21.895
“meaning a philosophy
based on objective reality.”

01:17:21.895 --> 01:17:25.133
So, then, is it possible to make
such simple statements

01:17:25.133 --> 01:17:28.120
of other philosophies like
my one for Objectivism?

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.881
Perhaps, or perhaps not.

01:17:29.881 --> 01:17:33.488
I will leave it to the adherents of
Kant, or Descartes, or Saint Augustine

01:17:33.488 --> 01:17:36.744
to distil such beliefs into
an easily recognisable essence.

01:17:36.744 --> 01:17:39.236
I will say on this front
that most philosophies

01:17:39.236 --> 01:17:40.853
except for Objectivism

01:17:40.853 --> 01:17:44.866
form an ecclectic hodge-podge of
random positions hastily strung together,

01:17:44.866 --> 01:17:47.500
and that to whatever
extent this is the case

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.120
one requires more
clarifications and asterisks

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:53.243
to be stuck onto an otherwise
neat statement of that philosophy.

01:17:53.243 --> 01:17:55.935
When it comes to some of
the more ecclectic philosophies,

01:17:55.935 --> 01:17:57.714
it becomes possible to identify it

01:17:57.714 --> 01:17:59.482
only by gesturing at the philosopher

01:17:59.482 --> 01:18:00.793
who thought it made sense.

01:18:00.793 --> 01:18:02.875
But, insofar as a given philosophy

01:18:02.875 --> 01:18:05.272
is integrated in its claims
and basic approach,

01:18:05.272 --> 01:18:08.735
one can identify it as easily
as I identify Objectivism:

01:18:08.735 --> 01:18:11.458
the philosophy of
the primacy of existence.

01:18:11.458 --> 01:18:14.525
Of course, I would be remiss
if I did not present some of the arguments

01:18:14.525 --> 01:18:16.213
provided by the closed Objectivists

01:18:16.213 --> 01:18:17.866
on why they think it is closed.

01:18:17.866 --> 01:18:19.284
Onkar Ghate has it that

01:18:19.284 --> 01:18:22.800
this is the normal way
of thinking of theories elsewhere:

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.528
So there’s Darwin’s theories in biology...
or evolutionary biology,

01:18:27.528 --> 01:18:30.699
and they’re Darwin’s theories,

01:18:30.699 --> 01:18:34.577
and they end when he
stops writing and dies.

01:18:34.577 --> 01:18:37.304
Then those are his theories in biology.

01:18:37.304 --> 01:18:39.546
Or Einstein’s theories in physics.

01:18:39.546 --> 01:18:42.986
They’re closed, again, when
he dies or stops writing.

01:18:42.986 --> 01:18:47.478
And that was the perspective

01:18:47.478 --> 01:18:50.987
that ARI adopted and
its a perspective I certainly agree with.

01:18:50.987 --> 01:18:55.305
But if you ask:
is philosophy open or closed?

01:18:56.159 --> 01:18:57.760
I think it's a different answer.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.894
Philosophy is open.

01:18:58.894 --> 01:19:02.140
So Objectivism and philosophy are...

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.223
Objectivism and truths in philosophy

01:19:05.223 --> 01:19:06.800
are not synonyms.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.290
He goes on to further address

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:11.922
the “Objectivism is truths in philosophy”
type of open Objectivism,

01:19:11.922 --> 01:19:13.345
which I agree with him on.

01:19:13.345 --> 01:19:14.828
What I disagree with him on,

01:19:14.828 --> 01:19:18.196
is his attempted analogising
of Rand to Darwin and Einstein.

01:19:18.196 --> 01:19:19.203
Notice that he said

01:19:19.203 --> 01:19:21.000
“Darwin’s theories in biology”

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.767
and “Einstein’s theories in physics”

01:19:22.767 --> 01:19:25.774
rather than “evolution”
or “general relativity.”

01:19:25.774 --> 01:19:28.438
Because the theories of
evolution and general relativity

01:19:28.438 --> 01:19:31.647
are decidedly <i>not</i> closed upon
the deaths of their originators.

01:19:31.647 --> 01:19:32.987
We know <i>for sure</i>

01:19:32.987 --> 01:19:37.159
that further discoveries need to be made
in the theory of general relativity,

01:19:37.159 --> 01:19:41.661
because it cannot account for phenomena
such as quantum gravity or dark matter.

01:19:41.661 --> 01:19:44.192
It is also possible to make
further discoveries

01:19:44.192 --> 01:19:46.868
under the broad umbrella
of the theory of evolution,

01:19:46.868 --> 01:19:48.910
but I know far less about biology

01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:51.373
so I cannot say exactly
what that would consist of.

01:19:51.373 --> 01:19:53.306
Indeed, nobody is debating over

01:19:53.306 --> 01:19:56.632
whether “Ayn Rand’s theories in philosophy”
is open or closed

01:19:56.632 --> 01:19:59.527
—clearly, whatever beliefs
Ayn Rand holds on philosophy

01:19:59.527 --> 01:20:01.941
is a closed set the instant she dies.

01:20:01.941 --> 01:20:03.636
But the word “Objectivism”

01:20:03.636 --> 01:20:06.651
–much like the words “evolution”
and “general relativity”

01:20:06.651 --> 01:20:09.628
does not refer to whatever
beliefs she happens to hold.

01:20:09.628 --> 01:20:12.758
It refers to the essential theory
that she was forwarding.

01:20:12.758 --> 01:20:14.801
That is, the theories of evolution

01:20:14.801 --> 01:20:16.419
and general relativity

01:20:16.419 --> 01:20:19.205
are not terms analogous to “philosophy”

01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:22.530
–the proper analogy there
would be “biology” and “physics”

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.347
–evolution and general relativity,
on the other hand,

01:20:25.347 --> 01:20:27.789
are specific theories in
their respective fields,

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:31.606
like how Objectivism is a specific
theory about philosophy.

01:20:31.606 --> 01:20:33.310
I will cap off this section

01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:35.431
with Rand’s nascent words on the topic

01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:36.330
—which to be clear

01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:39.190
were written before this
particular debate occurred:

01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:44.658
This is to say that I approve of
the publication of <i>The Objectivist Forum</i>,

01:20:44.658 --> 01:20:47.903
that it promises to be
a very interesting magazine,

01:20:47.903 --> 01:20:50.398
and that I recommend it to your attention.

01:20:50.398 --> 01:20:54.206
it is not, however,
the official voice of Objectivism

01:20:54.206 --> 01:20:57.702
and it is not my representative
or spokesman.

01:20:57.702 --> 01:20:59.355
As its name indicates,

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:02.590
this magazine is a <i>forum</i>
for students of Objectivism

01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:06.272
to discuss their ideas,
each speaking only for himself.

01:21:06.272 --> 01:21:12.259
If you wonder why I am so particular about
protecting the integrity of the term “Objectivism,”

01:21:12.259 --> 01:21:17.713
my reason is that “Objectivism” is
the name I have given to <i>my</i> philosophy

01:21:17.713 --> 01:21:22.884
— therefore, anyone using that name for some
philosophical hodgepodge of his own,

01:21:22.884 --> 01:21:26.755
without my knowledge or consent,
is guilty of the fraudulent presumption

01:21:26.755 --> 01:21:29.120
of trying to put thoughts into <i>my</i> brain

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.757
or of trying to pass
his thinking off as mine

01:21:31.757 --> 01:21:34.868
— an attempt which fails,
for obvious reasons).

01:21:34.868 --> 01:21:39.989
I chose the name “Objectivism” at a time
when my philosophy was beginning to be known

01:21:39.989 --> 01:21:44.760
and some people were
starting to call themselves “Randists.”

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.767
I am much too conceited
to allow such a use of my name.

01:21:47.767 --> 01:21:50.306
What is the proper policy on this issue?

01:21:50.306 --> 01:21:53.159
If you agree with some
tenets of Objectivism,

01:21:53.159 --> 01:21:54.899
but disagree with others,

01:21:54.899 --> 01:21:57.169
do not call yourself an Objectivist;

01:21:57.169 --> 01:22:00.724
give proper authorship credit
for the parts you agree with

01:22:00.724 --> 01:22:04.137
— and then indulge in
any flights of fancy you wish,

01:22:04.137 --> 01:22:05.483
on your own.

01:22:05.483 --> 01:22:09.880
This quoted text was specifically
selected by Onkar Ghate,

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.900
before anybody tries accusing me
of omitting important information.

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:15.963
Regardless, I do agree
with the closed Objectivists

01:22:15.963 --> 01:22:19.219
that this is evidence that Rand
would have been a closed Objectivist

01:22:19.219 --> 01:22:20.838
if she were alive for the debates.

01:22:20.838 --> 01:22:23.134
But, that Ayn Rand would take that position

01:22:23.134 --> 01:22:25.531
does not imply that it is the correct position.

01:22:25.531 --> 01:22:27.941
“Ayn Rand said so” isn’t an argument.

01:22:27.941 --> 01:22:30.400
At least the open Objectivism that I present

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.708
is not a philosophical hodgepodge

01:22:32.708 --> 01:22:35.120
—it is the properly
integrated form of the theory.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.202
And I am making no attempts
to represent any discoveries

01:22:38.202 --> 01:22:40.853
I have made as being discoveries
made by Ayn Rand,

01:22:40.853 --> 01:22:45.400
she deserves no credit for the numerous
innovations in legal theory I have made.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:48.367
This is precisely because
<i>Objectivism does not mean</i>

01:22:48.367 --> 01:22:50.603
<i>whatever beliefs in philosophy Ayn Rand held.</i>

01:22:50.603 --> 01:22:54.960
<i>Because</i> I hold that Objectivism
is a broader abstraction,

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.960
I am perfectly free to hold both
that there are correct Objectivist stances

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.314
that Ayn Rand did not hold

01:22:59.314 --> 01:23:02.494
<i>whilst</i> not pinning these
positions onto Ayn Rand.

01:23:02.494 --> 01:23:07.251
I give proper credit for the discovery of
the correct legal theory on <i>Objectivist terms</i>

01:23:07.251 --> 01:23:11.216
to Murray Rothbard, and then to myself
and other contributors for completing it.

01:23:11.216 --> 01:23:15.600
<i>This does not require that Objectivism means
whatever beliefs in philosophy Ayn Rand held.</i>

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:19.610
So then, why is it that I think
the anarcho-capitalist legal theory

01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:24.820
as formulated by myself is the proper
implication of prior Objectivist philosophy?

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.874
The reason is that I think Ayn Rand

01:23:26.874 --> 01:23:28.207
and her legion followers

01:23:28.207 --> 01:23:30.425
were all answering the wrong question

01:23:30.425 --> 01:23:32.302
when it came time to
formulate the politics.

01:23:32.302 --> 01:23:36.413
Namely: I think politics is not
a valid field of philosophy

01:23:36.413 --> 01:23:37.637
—law is.

01:23:37.637 --> 01:23:40.837
Peikoff states the question that
politics is trying to answer as:

01:23:40.837 --> 01:23:44.987
“what is right or wrong in terms of what
the government does, what society does,”

01:23:44.987 --> 01:23:46.569
or that:

01:23:46.569 --> 01:23:51.177
Politics, like ethics,
is a normative branch of philosophy.

01:23:51.177 --> 01:23:54.951
Politics defines the principles
of a proper social system,

01:23:54.951 --> 01:23:57.495
including the proper
functions of government.

01:23:57.495 --> 01:24:01.176
This is, once again, the fallacy
of the frozen abstraction.

01:24:01.176 --> 01:24:02.666
Allow me to highlight this

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:05.485
with respect to another example from Rand:

01:24:05.485 --> 01:24:09.326
Objectivists will often
hear a question such as:

01:24:09.326 --> 01:24:13.906
“What will be done about the poor or
the handicapped in a free society?”

01:24:13.906 --> 01:24:15.962
Observe that he does not ask:

01:24:15.962 --> 01:24:18.281
“Should anything be done?” but:

01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:19.545
“What will be done?”

01:24:19.545 --> 01:24:23.964
—as if the collectivist premise
had been tacitly accepted

01:24:23.964 --> 01:24:29.583
and all that remains is a discussion
of the means to implement it.

01:24:29.583 --> 01:24:33.080
In the case of politics, the Randians
have grafted the premise

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.220
that there should be a government
onto the very problem-statement.

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:39.933
This poisons every piece of analysis
they provide from this point on.

01:24:39.933 --> 01:24:42.393
Their formulation doesn’t
even consider the question

01:24:42.393 --> 01:24:43.926
“should there be a government?”

01:24:43.926 --> 01:24:45.979
it asks “how should
the government be run?”

01:24:45.979 --> 01:24:49.000
This snuck premise
is a collectivist deviation.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.886
“Society” or “the government”

01:24:50.886 --> 01:24:52.519
cannot do right or wrong

01:24:52.519 --> 01:24:53.845
—those are collective terms.

01:24:53.845 --> 01:24:57.426
Rand and all of her followers
on this front reify “society”

01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:00.397
as something that can be
good or bad, proper or improper.

01:25:00.397 --> 01:25:03.922
But society is not
an entity, it cannot act.

01:25:03.922 --> 01:25:07.920
We might as well make a new branch
of philosophy called murderology,

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.232
which asks the question:

01:25:08.232 --> 01:25:09.276
“how should men act,

01:25:09.276 --> 01:25:11.359
including what are
the proper methods of murder?

01:25:11.359 --> 01:25:12.530
Murder is a value to men

01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:14.602
only if it is the right
kind of murder, after all!”

01:25:14.602 --> 01:25:15.841
This is a gross deviation

01:25:15.841 --> 01:25:18.121
not only from the proper Objectivist line,

01:25:18.121 --> 01:25:19.792
but from philosophy itself.

01:25:19.792 --> 01:25:23.199
None of the other branches
are defined in such a crude fashion.

01:25:23.199 --> 01:25:24.220
Metaphysics isn’t

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:27.260
“what is there, and also
what is the world stuff?,”

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.111
epistemology isn’t

01:25:28.111 --> 01:25:30.792
“how do I know and also
why are the senses invalid?,”

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:31.687
and ethics isn’t

01:25:31.687 --> 01:25:34.723
“what should I do about it,
and what are therefore my duties?”

01:25:34.723 --> 01:25:38.170
So then why on Earth should one
accept such sloppy grafting on

01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:40.480
of a specific theory in Politics

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.566
–that there should be a government

01:25:41.566 --> 01:25:43.922
–to the broader abstraction
of politics itself?

01:25:43.922 --> 01:25:46.240
Say, I think theres a term for doing that.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.940
The fallacy of making cold abstractions?

01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:49.940
Something like that.

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.485
Just as it is collectivist to speculate on
what “society” should do for the poor,

01:25:53.485 --> 01:25:56.118
it is collectivist to
speculate on what “society”

01:25:56.118 --> 01:25:58.542
should do for those
whose rights are being violated.

01:25:58.542 --> 01:26:00.678
The proper response, in both cases, is:

01:26:00.678 --> 01:26:02.284
“if you want to do something about it,

01:26:02.284 --> 01:26:03.610
then do it

01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:04.708
—I am not my brothers keepers!”

01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:08.660
The Objectivists do present
various arguments against anarchism,

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:10.218
but before I address those

01:26:10.218 --> 01:26:14.380
I will give you my case for what should
go in place of the Randian politics.

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:17.940
We have seen that the error made
by Rand and others on this front

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:18.976
was in answering the wrong question,

01:26:18.976 --> 01:26:20.797
so what is the right question?

01:26:20.797 --> 01:26:22.431
What is the problem that men face

01:26:22.431 --> 01:26:24.422
that requires an answer from philosophy?

01:26:24.422 --> 01:26:27.194
The problem is that we live
in a world of scarce means,

01:26:27.194 --> 01:26:30.359
and as such men can come
into conflict with each other

01:26:30.359 --> 01:26:32.477
—so how should you deal with conflicts?

01:26:32.477 --> 01:26:34.457
This is the question that law poses.

01:26:34.457 --> 01:26:36.797
Perhaps Robinson Crusoe is on a desert island

01:26:36.797 --> 01:26:38.483
and comes across a stick in nature.

01:26:38.483 --> 01:26:39.430
He takes this stick

01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:41.245
and wishes to use it for spearfishing.

01:26:41.245 --> 01:26:42.829
As he is on his way to the ocean,

01:26:42.829 --> 01:26:45.189
another man, Friday, sees the same stick

01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:46.970
and decides to use it to stoke his fire.

01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:50.450
The two men cannot both
perform these actions at the same

01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:51.491
–they are mutually exclusive

01:26:51.491 --> 01:26:54.133
–such that if Friday went ahead
with his course of action,

01:26:54.133 --> 01:26:55.496
there there would be a conflict

01:26:55.496 --> 01:26:58.770
and one man would have to be
deprived of the attainment of his end.

01:26:58.770 --> 01:27:01.883
Notice that nowhere in the
formulation of this problem

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:05.820
have any additional unchecked
premises been introduced.

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.741
It is true that means are scarce

01:27:06.741 --> 01:27:08.459
and therefore conflicts are possible.

01:27:08.459 --> 01:27:11.360
And it is true that this is a problem
that ethics can answer

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.930
—namely, it answers it on the individual level.

01:27:13.930 --> 01:27:16.477
Should you initiate conflicts, or not?

01:27:16.477 --> 01:27:19.152
There are three basic
answers to this question:

01:27:19.152 --> 01:27:22.457
1. the law of the jungle
—initiate conflicts at your whim;

01:27:22.457 --> 01:27:25.979
2. mixed law
—sometimes initiate conflicts, and;

01:27:25.979 --> 01:27:29.533
3. the non-aggression principle
—don’t initiate conflicts.

01:27:29.533 --> 01:27:31.880
First let’s consider the law of the jungle

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.557
—what would a universal acceptance

01:27:33.557 --> 01:27:36.189
of conflict-engendering norms look like?

01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:38.208
If Crusoe were to take a stick from nature

01:27:38.208 --> 01:27:39.956
and try to use it for spearfishing,

01:27:39.956 --> 01:27:41.999
he would not be able to
complain under this system

01:27:41.999 --> 01:27:44.528
if Friday came along and
took that stick from him,

01:27:44.528 --> 01:27:47.374
because Crusoe could not claim
the stick as his <i>property</i>,

01:27:47.374 --> 01:27:50.332
the property right would rather
travel from person to person

01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:52.537
always being attached to the item itself.

01:27:52.537 --> 01:27:54.703
In other words, on such a view

01:27:54.703 --> 01:27:56.611
there would be no distinction whatsoever

01:27:56.611 --> 01:27:58.701
between <i>ownership</i> and <i>possession.</i>

01:27:58.701 --> 01:27:59.476
We would have

01:27:59.476 --> 01:28:01.059
–in the words of Stephan Kinsella

01:28:01.059 --> 01:28:02.870
–a “mere possessor” ethic.

01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:05.195
The issue with this view is that ownership

01:28:05.195 --> 01:28:08.292
–which we can define as
the <i>right</i> to possess a given scarce good

01:28:08.292 --> 01:28:10.594
–is necessarily distinct from possession.

01:28:10.594 --> 01:28:12.765
If there is some dispute between A and B

01:28:12.765 --> 01:28:15.200
over who should be the one
to control a given property,

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.809
then <i>both</i> A and B must
pre-suppose this to be the case.

01:28:18.809 --> 01:28:22.119
A is asserting that though B
might be able to actually obtain control,

01:28:22.119 --> 01:28:25.901
it would nevertheless be the case
that A <i>should</i> be the one to control it,

01:28:25.901 --> 01:28:29.717
and similarly B is asserting that though
A might be able to actually obtain control,

01:28:29.717 --> 01:28:33.767
it would nevertheless be the case that
B should be the one to actually control it.

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:35.373
So this mere possessor ethic,

01:28:35.373 --> 01:28:37.367
which the law of the jungle asserts,

01:28:37.367 --> 01:28:41.175
would require a conflation between
the concepts <i>ownership</i> and <i>possession</i>,

01:28:41.175 --> 01:28:44.372
that is to say that the law of
the jungle is the assertion

01:28:44.372 --> 01:28:46.450
that ownership rights are acquired

01:28:46.450 --> 01:28:48.709
by the mere act of taking
a given good from someone else

01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:51.840
—if A has a stick and
B takes that stick from him,

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.424
then the jungle-jurist says
that C could come along

01:28:54.424 --> 01:28:55.630
and take the stick from B

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:56.953
and then become the owner,

01:28:56.953 --> 01:29:00.845
i.e. that whomever is in possession
of the stick is in fact it’s owner.

01:29:00.845 --> 01:29:03.480
But, how exactly is a person able

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.500
to assert this jungle-law view
in defense of their actions?

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.557
We saw above that both A and B

01:29:08.557 --> 01:29:11.340
must pre-suppose the distinction
between ownership and possession

01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:14.325
—they are saying that <i>they</i>
should be the one to control the item

01:29:14.325 --> 01:29:15.797
which implies that they have a <i>right</i>

01:29:15.797 --> 01:29:17.600
to exclude other people from using it.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.603
We have this real problem of conflicts

01:29:19.603 --> 01:29:21.237
that we are trying to resolve

01:29:21.237 --> 01:29:23.963
and the jungle law view
is simply incommunicable

01:29:23.963 --> 01:29:26.786
by the fact that it is a
contradiction to even assert

01:29:26.786 --> 01:29:29.307
—the instant a man tries to defend his conduct

01:29:29.307 --> 01:29:31.644
by asserting that conflicts
should not be avoided

01:29:31.644 --> 01:29:33.370
and that rights are illusory

01:29:33.370 --> 01:29:35.765
he necessarily asserts
that conflicts should be avoided

01:29:35.765 --> 01:29:37.124
(when initiated against him)

01:29:37.124 --> 01:29:38.333
and that rights are real

01:29:38.333 --> 01:29:40.459
(when the thief is facing
a counter-attack).

01:29:40.459 --> 01:29:43.770
So this man would be left with
only the option of sealing up his lips

01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:45.285
and making no defense,

01:29:45.285 --> 01:29:48.817
living as an animal-beast ruled
by whatever whims he feels at the moment,

01:29:48.817 --> 01:29:52.124
with no concern for whether
his conduct is rationally defensible.

01:29:52.124 --> 01:29:55.294
So at best the jungle-law ethic
reduces into whim-worship,

01:29:55.294 --> 01:29:57.673
but recall above that ethics itself

01:29:57.673 --> 01:30:00.777
rests upon earlier conclusions
in metaphysics and epistemology,

01:30:00.777 --> 01:30:02.206
so upon what metaphysical

01:30:02.206 --> 01:30:05.245
and/or epistemic premises
does such an ethic rest?

01:30:05.245 --> 01:30:07.050
Fundamentally, we have the question of

01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:08.929
“how should we be dealing with conflicts,

01:30:08.929 --> 01:30:09.850
what is criminal?”

01:30:09.850 --> 01:30:11.190
and the jungle-jurist asserts:

01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:12.858
“who gives a damn? Might makes right;

01:30:12.858 --> 01:30:14.360
live by your arbitrary whims.”

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.440
What this means, if taken as a
serious ethical proposal,

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:20.208
is that whims are a
genuine source of knowledge,

01:30:20.208 --> 01:30:22.581
i.e. this is not only a whim-ethic,

01:30:22.581 --> 01:30:24.530
but a whim-epistemology

01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:25.424
—it all boils down to

01:30:25.424 --> 01:30:27.772
“I think this is true
because I feel like it is;”

01:30:27.772 --> 01:30:30.528
“I should take this spear
because I feel like I should.”

01:30:30.528 --> 01:30:33.284
But of course, epistemology
does not stand on it’s own,

01:30:33.284 --> 01:30:35.177
it is not primary in philosophy;

01:30:35.177 --> 01:30:39.380
rather a given epistemology rests
on prior metaphysical premises.

01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:41.646
So on what metaphysical premises

01:30:41.646 --> 01:30:43.544
does this whim-epistemology rest?

01:30:43.544 --> 01:30:45.183
What is really being said here

01:30:45.183 --> 01:30:48.199
is that if you simply <i>think</i> something
to be the case hard enough

01:30:48.199 --> 01:30:49.770
then it <i>is</i> the case;

01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:53.936
that your whims, your thoughts,
your consciousness is the basis of reality.

01:30:53.936 --> 01:30:56.104
That existence conforms
to your consciousness,

01:30:56.104 --> 01:30:57.701
rather than the other way around.

01:30:57.701 --> 01:31:00.121
This is the fallacy of the
primacy of consciousness.

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:01.759
This view of the law of the jungle

01:31:01.759 --> 01:31:03.630
or any other whim-based theory

01:31:03.630 --> 01:31:06.504
does and must rely on the
premise that consciousness

01:31:06.504 --> 01:31:07.515
–mere thoughts

01:31:07.515 --> 01:31:09.967
–have metaphysical primacy over existence.

01:31:09.967 --> 01:31:13.177
Next, let’s consider the
“mixed law” system(s);

01:31:13.177 --> 01:31:16.851
i.e. that conflicts should be avoided
under certain circumstances,

01:31:16.851 --> 01:31:18.168
but not always.

01:31:18.168 --> 01:31:20.841
First any mixed-law system
that can be reduced to

01:31:20.841 --> 01:31:23.609
“we must aggress in these arbitrary situations”

01:31:23.609 --> 01:31:26.703
is refuted by the above reasoning
against the law of the jungle.

01:31:26.703 --> 01:31:29.851
Allow me to now quickly introduce
a number of different proposals

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.222
for a mixed-law system

01:31:31.222 --> 01:31:34.847
such that I may draw your attention
to a common principle among them all:

01:31:34.847 --> 01:31:38.822
1. consequentialism—he whose victory
would yield the best outcome

01:31:38.822 --> 01:31:41.160
is he who should win the conflict at hand;

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:45.131
2. racism—he who is fighting for
the interests of the preferred race

01:31:45.131 --> 01:31:47.552
is he who should win the conflict at hand;

01:31:47.552 --> 01:31:51.425
3. Marxism—he who is fighting for
the interests of the proletariat

01:31:51.425 --> 01:31:53.601
is he who should win the conflict at hand;

01:31:53.601 --> 01:31:56.419
4. primitivism—he who is
fighting for apocalypse

01:31:56.419 --> 01:31:58.589
is he who should win the conflict at hand;

01:31:58.589 --> 01:32:02.508
monarchism—he who is deemed to be
the proper victor by the monarch

01:32:02.508 --> 01:32:04.755
is he who should win the conflict at hand;

01:32:04.755 --> 01:32:09.400
6. democratism—he who is deemed
to be the proper victor by majority opinion

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.754
is he who should win the conflict at hand;

01:32:11.754 --> 01:32:15.235
7. Rawlsianism—he who is deemed
to be the proper victor

01:32:15.235 --> 01:32:17.543
by a party situated behind a veil of ignorance

01:32:17.543 --> 01:32:20.780
is he who should win
the conflict at hand, and;

01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:23.179
8. imperialism—he who is
deemed to be an ally

01:32:23.179 --> 01:32:25.598
by the military leadership
of the preferred country

01:32:25.598 --> 01:32:27.655
is he who should win the conflict at hand.

01:32:27.655 --> 01:32:30.400
You will notice that on their face

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.575
these ideologies fall under two categories:

01:32:32.575 --> 01:32:34.119
(1) the class-based,

01:32:34.119 --> 01:32:36.878
i.e. “he who is part of the preferred class

01:32:36.878 --> 01:32:39.281
is he who should win the conflict at hand,”

01:32:39.281 --> 01:32:41.113
and (2) the whim-based,

01:32:41.113 --> 01:32:43.897
i.e. “he who is deemed to be
the proper victor by X

01:32:43.897 --> 01:32:46.303
is he who should win the conflict at hand.”

01:32:46.303 --> 01:32:49.541
It should be clear why the latter
would fall under the same reasoning

01:32:49.541 --> 01:32:51.461
as used against the law of the jungle;

01:32:51.461 --> 01:32:55.374
thus I shall focus my efforts on those
class-based mixed-law systems.

01:32:55.374 --> 01:32:57.477
Any form of class-based law

01:32:57.477 --> 01:32:59.450
is an ethic in the form:

01:32:59.450 --> 01:33:00.510
one rule for class A

01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:02.519
and another for class non-A.

01:33:02.519 --> 01:33:04.940
But by what possible means could one derive

01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:06.551
that one ethic applies to A

01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:09.884
and another <i>incompatible</i>
ethic applies to non-A?

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:11.943
Surely such an ethic could not be derived

01:33:11.943 --> 01:33:13.768
from the nature of man as such,

01:33:13.768 --> 01:33:15.800
because if it were

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.370
then we would have a universal principle,

01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:20.891
not one that applies only to
a particular subset of humanity.

01:33:20.891 --> 01:33:24.456
Therefore, such an ethic must
be arbitrarily particularised

01:33:24.456 --> 01:33:26.707
—we have an arbitrary
distinction which forms

01:33:26.707 --> 01:33:27.868
a class of humans

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:29.259
and a class of sub-humans,

01:33:29.259 --> 01:33:32.460
we do not here have
a rational ethic for <i>man.</i>

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:34.795
This particularisation then falls back

01:33:34.795 --> 01:33:36.416
into the primacy of consciousness

01:33:36.416 --> 01:33:37.832
and therefore fails.

01:33:37.832 --> 01:33:42.159
On top of this, there exists a built-in
self-destruct for any mixed law ethic,

01:33:42.159 --> 01:33:45.600
in the form of Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s
argument from argument.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.761
The basic idea behind this attack

01:33:46.761 --> 01:33:49.990
is found in noticing that there exists
an inescapable inconsistency

01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:52.472
when it comes to arguing
in favour of aggression,

01:33:52.472 --> 01:33:54.945
borne from the fact that argumentation is

01:33:54.945 --> 01:33:57.362
and must be a conflict-free interaction.

01:33:57.362 --> 01:33:58.837
When people have some dispute

01:33:58.837 --> 01:34:00.457
and they choose to argue about it,

01:34:00.457 --> 01:34:03.683
they are doing the exact opposite
of fighting over the dispute.

01:34:03.683 --> 01:34:07.723
That is, if Crusoe and Friday have
a disagreement over how to use a spear,

01:34:07.723 --> 01:34:10.352
then each party sitting down
and giving arguments

01:34:10.352 --> 01:34:11.999
as to why their use should go forth

01:34:11.999 --> 01:34:14.686
is quite distinct to each
party launching missiles

01:34:14.686 --> 01:34:16.433
and trying to stab the other to death

01:34:16.433 --> 01:34:18.891
in order that their use
may go forth unimpeded.

01:34:18.891 --> 01:34:21.800
That is, simply by arguing
about property rights,

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.285
you must pre-suppose
libertarian non-aggression

01:34:24.285 --> 01:34:27.360
in your act of peacefully attempting
to resolve the disagreement.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:30.186
For our above dispute
between Crusoe and Friday,

01:34:30.186 --> 01:34:32.127
if Friday is trying to convince Crusoe

01:34:32.127 --> 01:34:33.800
that the proper use of the spear

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:36.000
is to violate Crusoe’s bodily autonomy,

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.436
then he finds himself
in a practical contradiction,

01:34:38.436 --> 01:34:41.152
namely he is respecting
Crusoe’s bodily autonomy

01:34:41.152 --> 01:34:44.602
and is trying to achieve consent
from Crusoe by the act of arguing,

01:34:44.602 --> 01:34:46.537
whilst he is explicitly rejecting

01:34:46.537 --> 01:34:49.156
that Crusoe’s consent is
required in the first place.

01:34:49.156 --> 01:34:50.631
To escape this contradiction,

01:34:50.631 --> 01:34:52.358
Friday has two options:

01:34:52.358 --> 01:34:55.440
first, he can stop arguing
and go back to fighting over it,

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.497
or second, he can drop his claim that Crusoe’s
bodily autonomy should be violated.

01:34:59.497 --> 01:35:00.726
In this second case

01:35:00.726 --> 01:35:02.523
the mixed law or jungle ethic

01:35:02.523 --> 01:35:05.400
has trivially dropped out
of rational consideration,

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:06.426
and in the first case

01:35:06.426 --> 01:35:09.478
we have it that Friday has turned
himself into an animal-beast

01:35:09.478 --> 01:35:10.608
governed only by whim

01:35:10.608 --> 01:35:12.745
—which makes his ethic irrational still.

01:35:12.745 --> 01:35:14.118
What this argument does

01:35:14.118 --> 01:35:16.258
is highlight an implicit notion we have

01:35:16.258 --> 01:35:19.211
that such jungle ethics
are irrational and brutish;

01:35:19.211 --> 01:35:22.819
namely that it is simply inconsistent
and hypocritical for a person

01:35:22.819 --> 01:35:25.106
to even try to assert them in an argument

01:35:25.106 --> 01:35:27.670
—that if they truly believe
in their murderous creeds

01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:29.996
then why the hell aren’t
they living by them?

01:35:29.996 --> 01:35:32.717
There is a certain subtle
poison to address here

01:35:32.717 --> 01:35:36.470
that I have encountered more heavily
since the initial writing of this script.

01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:39.102
I should note that I am
indebted in my analysis here

01:35:39.102 --> 01:35:40.458
to Gee from Proheretics

01:35:40.458 --> 01:35:41.719
and Harry Binswanger

01:35:41.719 --> 01:35:44.962
—though the latter would almost
certainly denounce this entire video.

01:35:44.962 --> 01:35:46.177
I am writing this section

01:35:46.177 --> 01:35:46.949
and including it

01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:48.595
after I have already began editing

01:35:48.595 --> 01:35:50.500
because I believe it has to be included.

01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:54.430
Namely, the claim that the non-aggression
principle no longer applies

01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:57.099
in so-called “emergency circumstances,”

01:35:57.099 --> 01:36:01.901
or those that are “metaphysically abnormal;”
concretised as “the lifeboat scenario.”

01:36:01.901 --> 01:36:02.939
The situation is:

01:36:02.939 --> 01:36:05.374
there is only one spot left on a lifeboat,

01:36:05.374 --> 01:36:07.260
and two people are there who need it.

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:08.936
The claim is that it is right

01:36:08.936 --> 01:36:10.850
for both men to aggress
against the other

01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:12.785
in order to take the spot as his own.

01:36:12.785 --> 01:36:14.568
Immediately there is a problem.

01:36:14.568 --> 01:36:16.126
How the hell did we get here?

01:36:16.126 --> 01:36:19.190
How did each man find
himself in this situation

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:20.493
and why am I to believe

01:36:20.493 --> 01:36:23.920
that both were acting entirely
morally up to this point?

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.675
Ethics does not properly answer

01:36:25.675 --> 01:36:28.268
how to act in a single
snapshot of your life,

01:36:28.268 --> 01:36:31.332
completely disconnected and
disintegrated from the whole

01:36:31.332 --> 01:36:35.162
—because life itself is not a series
of disconnected snapshots.

01:36:35.162 --> 01:36:36.840
To explicate this problem,

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:39.909
consider a different scenario
that I have been given on this point.

01:36:39.909 --> 01:36:42.199
An asteroid is hurtling towards Earth,

01:36:42.199 --> 01:36:45.374
and it has a great enough mass
to kill billions of people.

01:36:45.374 --> 01:36:48.276
A scientist had previously
constructed a laser gun

01:36:48.276 --> 01:36:50.481
that is capable of
destroying this asteroid,

01:36:50.481 --> 01:36:52.201
but he refuses to use it.

01:36:52.201 --> 01:36:55.762
Would it be moral to steal this
laser gun to save humanity?

01:36:55.762 --> 01:36:57.205
Notice the framing here:

01:36:57.205 --> 01:36:58.544
we have an individual

01:36:58.544 --> 01:37:00.040
who is clearly more intelligent

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.281
than the idiot masses

01:37:01.281 --> 01:37:04.561
and was able to foresee the
eventuality of asteroid strikes

01:37:04.561 --> 01:37:06.955
and was able to create
the means to stop them

01:37:06.955 --> 01:37:09.625
and we are supposed
to side with the idiot masses.

01:37:09.625 --> 01:37:12.912
Rather: we are supposed
to imagine ourselves in their shoes.

01:37:12.912 --> 01:37:17.000
“You are an idiot who cannot be expected
to not bumble your way into disaster, after all;

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.494
so you should support
destroying the man who isn’t.”

01:37:19.494 --> 01:37:21.403
For any who have read Atlas Shrugged,

01:37:21.403 --> 01:37:24.235
it should be clear what
the counterfactual framing is:

01:37:24.235 --> 01:37:26.744
that Prometheus who stole
the fire of the Gods

01:37:26.744 --> 01:37:28.679
is the one who should be emulated.

01:37:28.679 --> 01:37:30.460
And that he should not grant his fire

01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:33.218
to those who would set
eagles to tear out his liver.

01:37:33.218 --> 01:37:35.405
“Mr. Rearden, if you saw Atlas,

01:37:35.405 --> 01:37:37.960
the giant who holds the
world on his shoulders,

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.040
if you saw that he stood,

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:40.675
blood running down his chest,

01:37:40.675 --> 01:37:41.653
his knees buckling,

01:37:41.653 --> 01:37:42.789
his arms trembling

01:37:42.789 --> 01:37:44.680
but still trying to hold the world aloft

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.164
with the last of his strength,

01:37:46.164 --> 01:37:47.365
and the greater his effort

01:37:47.365 --> 01:37:50.241
the heavier the world bore
down upon his shoulders

01:37:50.241 --> 01:37:52.346
—what would you tell him to do?”

01:37:52.346 --> 01:37:53.456
“I … don’t know.

01:37:53.456 --> 01:37:54.709
What … could he do?

01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:56.555
What would you tell him?”

01:37:56.555 --> 01:37:58.169
“To shrug.”

01:37:58.169 --> 01:38:01.400
This is the problem with their
implicit framing of the hypotheticals

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.261
as a single snapshot in time

01:38:03.261 --> 01:38:04.725
—an ethical cold-open,

01:38:04.725 --> 01:38:07.181
where the previous actions
cannot be analysed.

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:09.700
They assume that man is impotent as such,

01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:12.810
and cannot possibly forsee
potential threats to his life.

01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:16.397
This impotence is then used
as a justification of crime.

01:38:16.397 --> 01:38:19.421
Hypotheticals are not tools
to discover new philosophy;

01:38:19.421 --> 01:38:20.618
they have their place,

01:38:20.618 --> 01:38:21.910
but that is not it.

01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:26.890
In any instance where a moron has stumbled
his way into an emergency scenario,

01:38:26.890 --> 01:38:29.240
the immoral act has already occurred

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:32.435
by his negligence in getting
there in the first place.

01:38:32.435 --> 01:38:35.566
If I am beset by an angry
mob trying to kill me,

01:38:35.566 --> 01:38:37.894
it is a valid question to ask of me:

01:38:37.894 --> 01:38:39.379
how did I get here?

01:38:39.379 --> 01:38:41.101
Are the mob trying to kill me

01:38:41.101 --> 01:38:43.775
because I previously went
on a mass-murder spree?

01:38:43.775 --> 01:38:44.850
If that is so,

01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:47.628
is it moral for me to continue
the spree to survive?

01:38:47.628 --> 01:38:49.382
This is the second problem:

01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:50.910
the notion that survival

01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:53.266
is the sole ethical goal of man.

01:38:53.266 --> 01:38:57.720
This relies on the premise that
death is the standard of value,

01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:58.610
as against life.

01:38:58.610 --> 01:39:01.315
Survival just means avoidance of death,

01:39:01.315 --> 01:39:04.324
but death means non-existence
for the living being.

01:39:04.324 --> 01:39:08.898
When one abstracts away all
the particular details inherent in life,

01:39:08.898 --> 01:39:11.434
they come to the concept of death.

01:39:11.434 --> 01:39:12.470
So a null

01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:13.229
–a nothing

01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:14.110
–a zero

01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:16.390
–is being used as a guide for the something

01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:17.409
–the thing

01:39:17.409 --> 01:39:18.174
–the life.

01:39:18.174 --> 01:39:20.522
This is the fallacy of reification

01:39:20.522 --> 01:39:22.227
–literally “thing-making”

01:39:22.227 --> 01:39:24.723
–a nothing is being treated as a something.

01:39:24.723 --> 01:39:27.612
Death is not something that one can achieve

01:39:27.612 --> 01:39:30.648
—at the moment of death,
there is no “one” to speak of.

01:39:30.648 --> 01:39:31.889
Death is the end,

01:39:31.889 --> 01:39:32.836
the boundary,

01:39:32.836 --> 01:39:37.317
the non-existent as far as ethics
and philosophy itself is concerned.

01:39:37.317 --> 01:39:42.447
No man can possibly have philosophy be
his guide when certain death faces him.

01:39:42.447 --> 01:39:47.187
To ask what ethics has to say on a scenario
where a man is moments away from death

01:39:47.187 --> 01:39:49.988
is just as valid to ask of the epistemologist

01:39:49.988 --> 01:39:52.695
how man can possibly gain any knowledge

01:39:52.695 --> 01:39:55.749
as he is enveloped by the explosion
from a nuclear bomb.

01:39:55.749 --> 01:39:57.935
That man cannot gain knowledge here,

01:39:57.935 --> 01:40:01.349
does nothing to refute
epistemology or ethics.

01:40:01.349 --> 01:40:05.580
This is the same as the error
implicit in Cartesian doubt.

01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:07.995
Descartes tells us that the correct way
to obtain knowledge

01:40:07.995 --> 01:40:10.140
is to first doubt everything.

01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:13.611
I.e. take ignorance, falsehood,
error as the primary,

01:40:13.611 --> 01:40:17.570
and from there attempt to get
to knowledge, truth, understanding.

01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:20.219
Error refers to any deviation from truth,

01:40:20.219 --> 01:40:22.811
thus it cannot come <i>before</i> truth.

01:40:22.811 --> 01:40:25.223
Descartes steals the concept of error.

01:40:25.223 --> 01:40:26.449
For the same reason,

01:40:26.449 --> 01:40:29.820
death cannot act as a standard of value.

01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:32.120
Value is that which man acts
to gain and/or keep

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:34.587
—you cannot gain or keep death.

01:40:34.587 --> 01:40:37.845
Death is the negation of existence
for the living being,

01:40:37.845 --> 01:40:39.381
nothing is not something,

01:40:39.381 --> 01:40:41.322
something must be the standard,

01:40:41.322 --> 01:40:43.178
not the negation of something.

01:40:43.178 --> 01:40:46.831
So just as ignorance is not
the standard of knowledge,

01:40:46.831 --> 01:40:49.463
death is not the standard of life.

01:40:49.463 --> 01:40:52.432
In these scenarios we are
presented with two choices:

01:40:52.432 --> 01:40:54.510
either commit aggression against someone,

01:40:54.510 --> 01:40:55.718
or die.

01:40:55.718 --> 01:40:59.680
They treat “death” as if it is
an action one can take.

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:00.101
It is not.

01:41:00.101 --> 01:41:02.728
Ethics guides man on what
<i>actions</i> he should take

01:41:02.728 --> 01:41:06.320
<i>given the context of his life
as an integrated whole.</i>

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:09.300
It tells man that given
he has a certain nature,

01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.964
certain actions are proper to him.

01:41:10.964 --> 01:41:12.947
Death is not an action.

01:41:12.947 --> 01:41:14.780
It is the end of action.

01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:17.451
We have again the reification of a zero.

01:41:17.451 --> 01:41:22.647
This framing of ethics as guiding man
on what to do given the context of his life

01:41:22.647 --> 01:41:27.780
leads us to our third problem with
the framing given by the NAP-exceptionists.

01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:33.100
Namely, a misunderstanding of what
“context” means as applied to ethics.

01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:36.282
The context of ethics is that
you are a volitional being

01:41:36.282 --> 01:41:39.341
—i.e. a lifeform capable of making choices.

01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:41.147
Ethics goes out of context

01:41:41.147 --> 01:41:44.524
if and only if you can
no longer make choices.

01:41:44.524 --> 01:41:46.108
That is the situation

01:41:46.108 --> 01:41:48.271
when you can no longer count on ethics

01:41:48.271 --> 01:41:50.370
–or even philosophy–to guide you.

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:51.639
Because a guide is specifically

01:41:51.639 --> 01:41:52.959
a guide to action

01:41:52.959 --> 01:41:54.473
—a guide to choice.

01:41:54.473 --> 01:41:57.111
We are not outside of the context of ethics

01:41:57.111 --> 01:42:00.772
just because things are really
scary or really dangerous

01:42:00.772 --> 01:42:04.587
—this is precisely the moment
when ethics is particularly important.

01:42:04.587 --> 01:42:07.782
It is far less urgent that
one recall his principles

01:42:07.782 --> 01:42:10.392
when selecting which flavour
of ice cream he should buy

01:42:10.392 --> 01:42:12.143
or which colour he should paint his wall

01:42:12.143 --> 01:42:14.939
than when he is in a life or death scenario.

01:42:14.939 --> 01:42:16.683
This is the fourth key point:

01:42:16.683 --> 01:42:19.454
what it means to say that
something is a <i>principle</i>.

01:42:19.454 --> 01:42:20.900
As Binswanger states it:

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:22.959
A principle identifies an action

01:42:22.959 --> 01:42:25.362
that is required by the facts at hand.

01:42:25.362 --> 01:42:29.855
To violate a principle is to act as if
what is required were not required

01:42:29.855 --> 01:42:30.995
—a contradiction.

01:42:30.995 --> 01:42:34.294
The oft-heard excuse “Just this once” means:

01:42:34.294 --> 01:42:37.418
“It’s safe to accept just this one contradiction.”

01:42:37.418 --> 01:42:39.280
But accepting a contradiction

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.686
undercuts the whole
structure of one’s knowledge.

01:42:41.686 --> 01:42:45.110
It forces a puzzle-piece into
a space it does not fit,

01:42:45.110 --> 01:42:46.857
spoiling the overall picture

01:42:46.857 --> 01:42:49.406
(and leaving no place to
put the right piece).

01:42:49.406 --> 01:42:51.494
Just as epistemic principles

01:42:51.494 --> 01:42:54.355
are what man uses for his act of validation

01:42:54.355 --> 01:42:56.802
and thus the identification of facts,

01:42:56.802 --> 01:42:59.187
ethical principles are what man uses

01:42:59.187 --> 01:43:01.359
for his identification of values.

01:43:01.359 --> 01:43:04.680
You cannot drop ethical
principles “just this once”

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:05.832
or “just in emergencies”

01:43:05.832 --> 01:43:07.365
in order to gain values

01:43:07.365 --> 01:43:08.954
—you need those very principles

01:43:08.954 --> 01:43:11.507
to identify values in the first place.

01:43:11.507 --> 01:43:14.300
Your ethical principles
are the very framework,

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:16.790
the structure,
of your hierarchy of values.

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:20.951
It is literally impossible to identify
and integrate new values

01:43:20.951 --> 01:43:23.319
if you are not operating on principle.

01:43:23.319 --> 01:43:24.995
The instant you drop the principle,

01:43:24.995 --> 01:43:28.212
you are disintegrating
the entire apparatus necessary

01:43:28.212 --> 01:43:30.932
to seek and maintain objective values.

01:43:30.932 --> 01:43:33.856
The contradiction involved
redounds on the total;

01:43:33.856 --> 01:43:37.710
life becomes disintegrated
on the Heraclitian premise

01:43:37.710 --> 01:43:38.554
that we are in total flux

01:43:38.554 --> 01:43:40.734
left to be guided only by negation.

01:43:40.734 --> 01:43:43.152
If I am building a very complex bridge

01:43:43.152 --> 01:43:45.370
and just cannot for the life of me

01:43:45.370 --> 01:43:46.789
work out how to make the thing work

01:43:46.789 --> 01:43:48.761
given the materials currently available.

01:43:48.761 --> 01:43:50.445
It is not proper for me to decide

01:43:50.445 --> 01:43:53.220
that just this once I will
violate the principle

01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:56.133
that knowledge can be gained
only by looking outwards,

01:43:56.133 --> 01:44:00.295
instead deciding I will try to contact
the Platonic Form of Bridge

01:44:00.295 --> 01:44:02.291
and build based on that.

01:44:02.291 --> 01:44:04.546
If I do this, the bridge will collapse,

01:44:04.546 --> 01:44:07.687
and hopefully nobody
is around when it happens.

01:44:07.687 --> 01:44:11.890
The goal of ethics is to tell man
how to live the good life.

01:44:11.890 --> 01:44:13.441
How to flourish.

01:44:13.441 --> 01:44:15.968
Not how to live the long life.

01:44:15.968 --> 01:44:19.451
To sacrifice the good life
at the altar of the long life

01:44:19.451 --> 01:44:21.591
is to sacrifice life for death;

01:44:21.591 --> 01:44:24.445
to substitute the sacred for the profane.

01:44:24.445 --> 01:44:27.636
To be sure, the fact of death
is important for ethics,

01:44:27.636 --> 01:44:30.600
but not because it is the standard.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.235
Rather, death highlights why we
<i>need</i> a standard in the first place.

01:44:34.235 --> 01:44:37.691
It is because you are faced with
the inevitability of death

01:44:37.691 --> 01:44:39.559
that you must know how to live.

01:44:39.559 --> 01:44:41.844
“Inevitability” is the key word here:

01:44:41.844 --> 01:44:44.659
if ethics were truly answering
the question of survival,

01:44:44.659 --> 01:44:47.291
then it would be a completely failed pursuit.

01:44:47.291 --> 01:44:48.737
Every man will die.

01:44:48.737 --> 01:44:51.230
Thus on death-as-the-standard ethics;

01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:53.577
every man is cursed with the original sin:

01:44:53.577 --> 01:44:57.440
he becomes more and more evil
as he walks towards the grave

01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:59.527
—desperately clamouring onto sustenance

01:44:59.527 --> 01:45:01.838
as he is slowly doomed
to be an eternal Satan

01:45:01.838 --> 01:45:03.772
as the Platonic form of Misery.

01:45:03.772 --> 01:45:04.486
That is:

01:45:04.486 --> 01:45:07.680
the dead man is reified as the evil man,

01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:09.888
the mystic incarnation of Death.

01:45:09.888 --> 01:45:13.659
Every man is pre-determined
towards this horrid outcome.

01:45:13.659 --> 01:45:17.846
Survivalism, then, is the coating
of religious afterlife myths

01:45:17.846 --> 01:45:19.805
in the language of Ayn Rand.

01:45:19.805 --> 01:45:23.469
All of this gives license
for epistemic negligence.

01:45:23.469 --> 01:45:26.983
The practical implication, is that
man turns off his mind,

01:45:26.983 --> 01:45:29.627
and does not look into his available options.

01:45:29.627 --> 01:45:31.692
The second he is beset by danger,

01:45:31.692 --> 01:45:36.680
he quietly says to himself that this must
be one of those emergency scenarios,

01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.563
and he does not bother to look for a way out.

01:45:38.563 --> 01:45:40.673
Instead, he becomes a parasite,

01:45:40.673 --> 01:45:43.763
and feasts upon the flesh of the men
who did find the way out.

01:45:43.763 --> 01:45:47.336
Further: how exactly is a man to ever identify

01:45:47.336 --> 01:45:49.809
that he is in a situation
where he must aggress?

01:45:49.809 --> 01:45:53.110
What is his guiding ethical
principle in the situation

01:45:53.110 --> 01:45:55.437
where ethical principles no longer apply?

01:45:55.437 --> 01:45:57.550
Is man required to be omniscient

01:45:57.550 --> 01:46:00.851
in order to foresee all of the
possibilities in a situation

01:46:00.851 --> 01:46:02.812
that was apparently unforseeable?

01:46:02.812 --> 01:46:06.663
In emergencies, one is never
actually presented with two options.

01:46:06.663 --> 01:46:09.279
There are innumerable different
options to exhaust,

01:46:09.279 --> 01:46:10.916
none of which will be attempted

01:46:10.916 --> 01:46:15.910
if one is guided by the cowardly
premise that survival is all that matters.

01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:18.874
After all, what lowlife criminal
has not used the excuse

01:46:18.874 --> 01:46:21.560
that they simply had
no choice but to aggress?

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.174
Perhaps they had a bad upbringing,

01:46:23.174 --> 01:46:25.949
or they suffered poor
socioeconomic circumstances,

01:46:25.949 --> 01:46:28.295
or they were being exploited
by the capitalists.

01:46:28.295 --> 01:46:30.570
These are all wolves’ tears,

01:46:30.570 --> 01:46:32.671
and should be discarded as such.

01:46:32.671 --> 01:46:35.222
I do not buy any of these claims from people

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:37.962
that there is just no possible way
for them to survive

01:46:37.962 --> 01:46:39.665
without becoming parasites.

01:46:39.665 --> 01:46:42.271
These claims strike me as
those that could be made

01:46:42.271 --> 01:46:45.186
by the many moochers
present in Ayn Rand’s fiction.

01:46:45.186 --> 01:46:47.887
Take Hugh Glass as the paradigm example.

01:46:47.887 --> 01:46:49.767
He was enslaved to a group of pirates

01:46:49.767 --> 01:46:52.132
and was able to escape with
one other gentleman.

01:46:52.132 --> 01:46:55.458
The two men found themselves
in the cannibal Pawnee territory,

01:46:55.458 --> 01:46:58.476
with no map, and severely limited provisions.

01:46:58.476 --> 01:47:00.230
They were captured by the cannibals,

01:47:00.230 --> 01:47:03.962
and Hugh was forced to watch
as his companion was burned alive.

01:47:03.962 --> 01:47:05.284
Before they took his life,

01:47:05.284 --> 01:47:07.356
he was able to negotiate for his safety

01:47:07.356 --> 01:47:11.730
by trading exotic pigments that
could be used as war paint.

01:47:11.730 --> 01:47:12.482
After being let go,

01:47:12.482 --> 01:47:14.369
Hugh would go into the fur trade,

01:47:14.369 --> 01:47:16.212
and would join a fur-trading expedition

01:47:16.212 --> 01:47:19.463
that was almost entirely
wiped out by the Ree Indians.

01:47:19.463 --> 01:47:21.572
After this, he encountered a grizzly bear,

01:47:21.572 --> 01:47:23.897
which proceeded to begin
tearing his flesh off

01:47:23.897 --> 01:47:25.827
and feeding him alive to her cubs.

01:47:25.827 --> 01:47:27.513
Figuring that he was sure to die,

01:47:27.513 --> 01:47:32.299
his few remaining compatriots took
all of his supplies and left him for dead.

01:47:32.299 --> 01:47:33.707
He did not die.

01:47:33.707 --> 01:47:35.474
He woke up a few days later.

01:47:35.474 --> 01:47:38.567
He found that he could no longer
move an arm and a leg.

01:47:38.567 --> 01:47:40.870
He crawled his way to collect supplies,

01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:42.832
still half-dead from the mauling.

01:47:42.832 --> 01:47:46.411
He would sanitise his wounds using
maggots from a rotting tree stump,

01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:52.858
and after 6 months of slowly making his way
down a 250 mile stretch of the Yellowstone river,

01:47:52.858 --> 01:47:55.433
he finally found himself at Fort Kiowa,

01:47:55.433 --> 01:47:57.860
and was able to make a recovery.

01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:02.320
Was Hugh Glass in metaphysically
abnormal circumstances?

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:05.512
Was survival impossible to him without aggression?

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:07.325
Apparently not.

01:48:07.325 --> 01:48:12.140
So, we have it that there are three possible
solutions to the correct problem-statement of law,

01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:13.186
two of them are false,

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:17.177
leaving us only with the non-aggression
principle as the correct answer.

01:48:17.177 --> 01:48:21.147
Refer to my course on how the rest of
the legal theory is derived from the NAP,

01:48:21.147 --> 01:48:23.028
and any Randroids in the audience

01:48:23.028 --> 01:48:25.304
who find themselves
screaming about rationalism

01:48:25.304 --> 01:48:26.940
because I used deductive reasoning

01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:29.164
can feel free to sob away all they want

01:48:29.164 --> 01:48:31.528
—but if I can pierce the veil
of tears for a moment,

01:48:31.528 --> 01:48:32.880
I would ask them to articulate

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:35.886
exactly what about my preceding
reasoning is incorrect,

01:48:35.886 --> 01:48:38.969
rather than just screaming about
how Peikoff one time said something

01:48:38.969 --> 01:48:40.819
that sort of sounds like what they want to say.

01:48:40.819 --> 01:48:43.562
Regardless, I can now move onto
some of the objections

01:48:43.562 --> 01:48:45.738
that the Randians have raised against anarchism.

01:48:45.738 --> 01:48:49.364
Do note that this is one area where
the writing is laughably sparse,

01:48:49.364 --> 01:48:50.703
and for good reason

01:48:50.703 --> 01:48:53.674
—namely, they lack any solid
theoretical objections

01:48:53.674 --> 01:48:56.531
so prefer to give a very light
treatment to the topic

01:48:56.531 --> 01:49:00.125
and never with an anarcho-Objectivist
there to provide counter-arguments.

01:49:00.125 --> 01:49:01.658
Rand defines government as

01:49:01.658 --> 01:49:04.032
“an institution that holds the exclusive power

01:49:04.032 --> 01:49:06.119
to enforce certain rules of social conduct

01:49:06.119 --> 01:49:08.310
in a given geographical area,”

01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:09.452
and on this definition,

01:49:09.452 --> 01:49:12.157
anarchism is supposed to represent
a floating abstraction

01:49:12.157 --> 01:49:16.323
—i.e. an abstraction
with no concrete referent:

01:49:16.323 --> 01:49:18.920
Anarchy, as a political concept,

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:21.413
is a naive floating abstraction:

01:49:21.413 --> 01:49:23.994
for all the reasons discussed above,

01:49:23.994 --> 01:49:27.109
a society without an organized government

01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:30.029
would be at the mercy of the first criminal

01:49:30.029 --> 01:49:31.177
who came along

01:49:31.177 --> 01:49:34.905
and who would precipitate it
into the chaos of gang warfare.

01:49:34.905 --> 01:49:37.814
But the possibility of human immorality

01:49:37.814 --> 01:49:40.747
is not the only objection to anarchy:

01:49:40.747 --> 01:49:45.622
even a society whose every member
were fully rational and faultlessly moral,

01:49:45.622 --> 01:49:47.850
could not function in a state of anarchy;

01:49:47.850 --> 01:49:52.590
it is the need of objective
laws and of an arbiter

01:49:52.590 --> 01:49:55.489
for honest disagreements among men

01:49:55.489 --> 01:49:58.246
that necessitates the establishment
of a government.

01:49:58.246 --> 01:50:00.732
First, there is the false premise

01:50:00.732 --> 01:50:03.091
that without a monopoly
on rights enforcement

01:50:03.091 --> 01:50:06.230
all that is left is brute violence
and gang warfare.

01:50:06.230 --> 01:50:07.703
As I have explained earlier,

01:50:07.703 --> 01:50:11.025
competing insurance firms
tend to do a far better job

01:50:11.025 --> 01:50:14.244
at enforcing rights than any
monopolist could hope to.

01:50:14.244 --> 01:50:18.883
Second, there is the false premise that anarchy
means no objective laws or arbitration.

01:50:18.883 --> 01:50:21.744
This is a point that is frequently
repeated by the Randians,

01:50:21.744 --> 01:50:23.558
and never substantiated.

01:50:23.558 --> 01:50:27.389
It is the premise that you need
some monopolist to “make the law objective”

01:50:27.389 --> 01:50:30.316
—but law is <i>discovered</i> not <i>produced.</i>

01:50:30.316 --> 01:50:33.564
Competing arbitration firms
can all appeal to reality

01:50:33.564 --> 01:50:36.076
to discover what the objective
legal principles are

01:50:36.076 --> 01:50:38.875
which they can then apply
to some specific case.

01:50:38.875 --> 01:50:43.235
Honest disagreements can be resolved without
having a monopoly on dispute resolution.

01:50:43.235 --> 01:50:46.655
A recent variant of anarchistic theory,

01:50:46.655 --> 01:50:50.539
which is befuddling some of the
younger advocates of freedom,

01:50:50.539 --> 01:50:54.838
is a weird absurdity called
“competing governments.”

01:50:54.838 --> 01:50:58.474
Accepting the basic premise
of the modern statists

01:50:58.474 --> 01:51:01.838
– who see no difference between
the functions of government

01:51:01.838 --> 01:51:04.326
and the functions of industry,

01:51:04.326 --> 01:51:06.600
between force and production,

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:10.094
and who advocate government
ownership of business

01:51:10.094 --> 01:51:15.835
– the proponents of “competing governments”
take the other side of the same coin

01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:20.719
and declare that since competition
is so beneficial to business,

01:51:20.719 --> 01:51:23.280
it should also be applied to government.

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:27.146
Instead of a single, monopolistic government,
they declare,

01:51:27.146 --> 01:51:31.974
there should be a number of different governments
in the same geographical area,

01:51:31.974 --> 01:51:35.710
competing for the allegiance
of individual citizens,

01:51:35.710 --> 01:51:41.108
with every citizen free to “shop” and
to patronize whatever government he chooses.

01:51:41.108 --> 01:51:44.159
Remember that forcible restraint of men

01:51:44.159 --> 01:51:48.098
is the only service a government has to offer.

01:51:48.098 --> 01:51:52.989
Ask yourself what a competition
in forcible restraint would have to mean.

01:51:52.989 --> 01:51:54.726
Indeed, if government means

01:51:54.726 --> 01:51:57.206
“an institution that holds the exclusive power

01:51:57.206 --> 01:51:59.304
to enforce certain rules of social conduct

01:51:59.304 --> 01:52:01.079
in a given geographical area,”

01:52:01.079 --> 01:52:04.908
then we have successfully defined away any
“competing governments” anarchism.

01:52:04.908 --> 01:52:08.214
But this does not begin to address
the anarcho-capitalist case.

01:52:08.214 --> 01:52:10.331
If government must mean a monopolist,

01:52:10.331 --> 01:52:14.208
then competition in rights enforcement
does not entail competing governments.

01:52:14.208 --> 01:52:15.517
Competition in this arena

01:52:15.517 --> 01:52:18.880
means that you can pay whomever
you like to enforce your rights

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.157
—nothing else.

01:52:20.157 --> 01:52:22.308
Rand continues with a hypothetical scenario

01:52:22.308 --> 01:52:26.308
that is supposed to demonstrate the absurdity
of competition in rights enforcement:

01:52:26.308 --> 01:52:30.468
suppose Mr. Smith,
a customer of Government A,

01:52:30.468 --> 01:52:37.137
suspects that his next-door neighbor, Mr. Jones,
a customer of Government B, has robbed him;

01:52:37.137 --> 01:52:41.280
a squad of Police A proceeds
to Mr. Jones’ house

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:44.602
and is met at the door by
a squad of Police B,

01:52:44.602 --> 01:52:49.670
who declare that they do not accept
the validity of Mr. Smith’s complaint

01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:53.611
and do not recognize
the authority of Government A.

01:52:53.611 --> 01:52:55.668
What happens then?

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:57.596
You take it from there.

01:52:57.596 --> 01:52:59.290
How utterly absurd!

01:52:59.290 --> 01:53:02.452
I might as well dream up my
own fantasy to dispute this theory:

01:53:02.452 --> 01:53:04.590
what if instead of Government A and B,

01:53:04.590 --> 01:53:06.359
we had just the one government;

01:53:06.359 --> 01:53:09.688
Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones each have
their own friends in the government.

01:53:09.688 --> 01:53:11.594
Then Smith tells his government friends

01:53:11.594 --> 01:53:13.350
that Jones stole his wallet,

01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:16.880
and of course this must obviously
lead to the great war of the wallets!

01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:19.538
Millions die in the great and
bloody war for power

01:53:19.538 --> 01:53:22.942
until one side prevails and genocides
those who assert the incorrect view

01:53:22.942 --> 01:53:24.870
on whether the wallet was stolen or not.

01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:27.575
What Rand forgets in
her random hypothesizing,

01:53:27.575 --> 01:53:29.325
is that hypothetical scenarios

01:53:29.325 --> 01:53:31.489
are not tools to discover philosophy.

01:53:31.489 --> 01:53:34.570
They have many brilliant uses
in checking that one is consistent

01:53:34.570 --> 01:53:38.172
or in trying to apply philosophical
principles to cleanly defined scenarios

01:53:38.172 --> 01:53:40.121
—but they cannot do anything beyond this.

01:53:40.121 --> 01:53:43.039
What would <i>actually</i> happen in such a scenario,

01:53:43.039 --> 01:53:45.930
is that neither <i>firm</i> wants to go to random war,

01:53:45.930 --> 01:53:48.126
so they would investigate who the aggressor is

01:53:48.126 --> 01:53:49.549
and seek damages from him.

01:53:49.549 --> 01:53:55.124
It is the state which is capable of externalising
any costs of great wars onto vast arrays of victims

01:53:55.124 --> 01:53:56.927
—not private firms.

01:53:56.927 --> 01:53:58.883
Peikoff has his own retorts to anarchism,

01:53:58.883 --> 01:54:01.989
which stand as being
just as absurd as Rand’s:

01:54:01.989 --> 01:54:05.095
Anarchism is the idea that there
should be no government.

01:54:05.095 --> 01:54:08.141
In Objectivist terms, this
amounts to the view

01:54:08.141 --> 01:54:12.456
that every man should defend himself
by using physical force against others

01:54:12.456 --> 01:54:14.268
whenever he feels like it,

01:54:14.268 --> 01:54:18.123
with no objective standards
of justice, crime, or proof.

01:54:18.123 --> 01:54:20.944
This is a near-explicit straw man
attack on anarchism.

01:54:20.944 --> 01:54:23.414
Anarchism is the view that there
should be no government

01:54:23.414 --> 01:54:25.520
–if government means a monopoly force-user

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.054
–but that does not even
come close to implying

01:54:28.054 --> 01:54:31.594
“that every man should defend himself
by using physical force against others

01:54:31.594 --> 01:54:32.893
whenever he feels like it,

01:54:32.893 --> 01:54:35.667
with no objective standards
of justice, crime, or proof.”

01:54:35.667 --> 01:54:39.014
What an absolutely absurd claim
that is on its face.

01:54:39.014 --> 01:54:42.233
I would be somewhat willing to
excuse utter nonsense like this

01:54:42.233 --> 01:54:44.875
if it were written in a time
prior to Murray Rothbard,

01:54:44.875 --> 01:54:45.990
but it wasn’t

01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:48.767
—Peikoff is just openly endorsing
the false alternative

01:54:48.767 --> 01:54:51.177
that either there should be
a monopoly on force,

01:54:51.177 --> 01:54:54.257
or everyone should just use whatever
force they want at their whim.

01:54:54.257 --> 01:54:56.927
I’m frankly shocked that he
never once considered

01:54:56.927 --> 01:55:00.224
whether individual men could discover
and apply philosophy on their own

01:55:00.224 --> 01:55:03.055
when it comes to the question of
when the use of force is licit.

01:55:03.055 --> 01:55:05.122
Peikoff continues:

01:55:05.122 --> 01:55:09.392
“What if an individual does not want
to delegate his right of self-defense?”

01:55:09.392 --> 01:55:11.284
the anarchist frequently asks.

01:55:11.284 --> 01:55:13.719
“Isn’t that a legitimate
aspect of ‘freedom’?”

01:55:13.719 --> 01:55:16.287
The question implies that a “free man”

01:55:16.287 --> 01:55:19.218
is one with the right to enact his desire,

01:55:19.218 --> 01:55:20.550
any desire,

01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:23.359
simply because it is his desire,

01:55:23.359 --> 01:55:25.232
including the desire to use force.

01:55:25.232 --> 01:55:28.800
This means the equation of “freedom”
with whim-worship.

01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:33.961
Philosophically, the underlying premise is
subjectivism (of the personal variety).

01:55:33.961 --> 01:55:37.086
Again, the underlying premise is decidedly <i>not</i>

01:55:37.086 --> 01:55:39.173
that a man may do <i>anything</i> he wants

01:55:39.173 --> 01:55:41.014
simply because he wants it

01:55:41.014 --> 01:55:43.920
—the underlying premise is that a man
may defend himself

01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:47.533
if he wishes or delegate this defense
to anybody he sees fit.

01:55:47.533 --> 01:55:50.410
Nowhere in this claim is there any implication

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:52.901
that people may engage
in random acts of violence

01:55:52.901 --> 01:55:55.477
or use arbitrary means
to defend their property.

01:55:55.477 --> 01:55:58.638
That is a patent absurdity
and false alternative

01:55:58.638 --> 01:56:01.787
presented to us by the people who
are supposed to have as their banner

01:56:01.787 --> 01:56:05.356
that they check premises and
never accept false alternatives.

01:56:05.356 --> 01:56:08.377
The collectivist poison that Rand
grafted onto her politics

01:56:08.377 --> 01:56:10.520
has yielded legion derivative errors,

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:13.869
not least of which is her support
of intellectual “property.”

01:56:13.869 --> 01:56:15.700
If you want to know why that is wrong,

01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:17.318
you have to watch this video

01:56:17.318 --> 01:56:19.626
where I explain that every form of IP

01:56:19.626 --> 01:56:24.645
is an anathema to the objective principles of law.
