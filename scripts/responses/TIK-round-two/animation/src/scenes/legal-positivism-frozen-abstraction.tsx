  // Legal positivism is one specific theory about what the law is, namely it is the thesis that the existence and content of law depends upon social facts, and not on its merits.[fn:26] In other words, the legal positivist claims that law is "posited," i.e. decreed by some authority, rather than discovered by jurists. This leaves us with a gross false alternative: arbitrary law declared by politicians vs arbitrary law declared by bandits; agression vs agression; might vs might. It is the dictum of every great villain in the history of philosophy: heads I win, tails you lose.
