// Now that it has been established that anarchism is definitively not chaos, it is worth explaining exactly how defense services could be provided on the free market. After all, some people are criminal, and the free society would need a way to deal with them. It is a general rule of economics that a free market can more efficiently provide any good than state central planning;[fn:28] however, because of that it is not possible for me to explain the specific bureaucratic structure that would obtain on the market to provide the service of defending one's rights. Just as it wouldn't be possible to explain what the restaurant industry would look like before one had developed. Regardless, it is possible to discuss some likely or possible features that could exist.

  // First, I must deconstruct the myth of collective security, most prominently advanced by Thomas Hobbes. The destruction he wrought in epistemology by conflating empiricism with nominalism-sensualism can be found in the political realm also---it is accepted by legion political philosophers and economists that a only a state can provide security against invasions of one's property. The argument goes that in the state of nature men are all snarling beasts who are constantly at each others throats, doing anything in their power to invade and expropriate what has been produced by others. In other words, Hobbes has it that there would be a permanent underproduction of security---each individual, left to his own devices, would spend too little on his own defense, thus constant interpersonal warfare would result.

Surely the sovereign is just as brutish as his subjects and now has the territorial monopoly and compulsory funding to externalise the costs of his aggression onto a vast array of victims who are forced to pay for their own victimisation.
