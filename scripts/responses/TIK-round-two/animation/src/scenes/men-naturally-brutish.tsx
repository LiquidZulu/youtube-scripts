  // Furthermore, the entire purpose of protecting rights in the first place is to allow for the flourishing of mankind. The reason why Crusoe would want to be free of conflict is so that he can be productive. Thus shifting the infringement of rights onto an institutionalised (protected) anti-productive class is an anathema to the very problem that had to be solved in the first place, as such an institution would tend to maximise the price of protection (i.e. taxes) whilst minimising the quality.

  // Quite simply, given that the principle of government requires that it be a judicial monopoly with the power to tax, any notion of limiting it's power and safeguarding individual life and property is illusory; necessarily the state tends towards greater expropriation and less protection, because the sovereign is motivated by self-interest (albeit irrational) and the disutility of labour just as anyone else. Why allocate more resources towards protecting citizens than the minimum required to keep them in line and preserve their property for your own future expropriation? On Hobbes, the sovereign would /have/ to do this because he is supposed to be a brute.
