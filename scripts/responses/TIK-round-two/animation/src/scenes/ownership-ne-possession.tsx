  // So this mere possessor ethic, which the law of the jungle asserts, would require a conflation of the concepts /ownership/ and /possession/, that is to say that the law of the jungle is the assertion that ownership rights are acquired by the mere act of taking a given good from someone else---if $A$ has a stick and $B$ takes that stick from him, then the jungle-jurist says that $C$ could come along and take the stick from $B$ and then become the owner, i.e. that whomever is in possession of the stick is in fact it's owner. But, how exactly is a person able to assert this jungle-law view in defense of their actions? We saw above that both $A$ and $B$ must pre-suppose the distinction between ownership and possession---they are saying that /they/ should control the item which implies that they have a /right/ to exclude other people from using it.[fn:59]
