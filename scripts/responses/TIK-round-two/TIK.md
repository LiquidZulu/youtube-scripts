### The Lifeboat Scenario

There is a certain subtle poison to address here that I have encountered more heavily since the initial writing of this script. I should note that I am indebted in my analysis here to Gee from Proheretics and Harry Binswanger&#x2014;though the latter would almost certainly denounce this entire video.

I am writing this section and including it after I have already began editing because I believe it must be addressed here. Namely, the claim that the non-aggression principle no longer applies in so-called &ldquo;emergency circumstances,&rdquo; or those that are &ldquo;metaphysically abnormal;&rdquo; concretised as &ldquo;the lifeboat scenario.&rdquo;

The situation is: there is only one spot left on a lifeboat, and two people are there who need it. The claim is that it is right for both men to aggress against the other in order to take the spot as his own. Immediately there is a problem. How the hell did we get here? How did each man find himself in this situation and why am I to believe that both were acting entirely morally up to this point? Ethics does not properly answer how to act in a single snapshot of your life, completely disconnected and disintegrated from the whole&#x2014;because life itself is not a series of disconnected snapshots.

To explicate this problem, consider a different scenario that I have been given on this point. An asteroid is hurtling towards Earth, and it has a great enough mass to kill billions of people. A scientist had previously constructed a laser gun that is capable of destroying this asteroid, but he refuses to use it. Would it be moral to steal this laser gun to save humanity? Notice the framing here: we have an individual who is clearly more intelligent than the idiot masses and was able to foresee the eventuality of asteroid strikes and was able to create the means to stop them and we are supposed to side with the idiot masses. Rather: we are supposed to imagine ourselves in their shoes. &ldquo;You are an idiot who cannot be expected to not bumble your way into disaster, after all; so you should support destroying the man who isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

For any who have read Atlas Shrugged, it should be clear what the counterfactual framing is: that Prometheus who stole the fire of the Gods is the one who should be emulated. And that he should not grant his fire to those who would set eagles to tear out his liver.

> &ldquo;Mr. Rearden, [&#x2026;] if you saw Atlas, the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw that he stood, blood running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms trembling but still trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his strength, and the greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders&#x2014;what would you tell him to do?&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;I &#x2026; don&rsquo;t know. What &#x2026; could he do? What would you tell him?&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;To shrug.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

This is the problem with their implicit framing of the hypotheticals as a single snapshot in time&#x2014;an ethical cold-open, where the previous actions cannot be analysed. They assume that man is impotent as such, and cannot possibly forsee potential threats to his life. This impotence is then used as a justification of crime. Hypotheticals are not tools to discover new philosophy; they have their place, but that is not it. In any instance where a moron has stumbled his way into an emergency scenario, the immoral act has already occurred by his negligence in getting there in the first place. If I am beset by an angry mob trying to kill me, it is a valid question to ask of me: how did I get here? Are the mob trying to kill me because I previously went on a mass-murder spree? If that is so, is it moral for me to continue the spree to survive?

This is the second problem: the notion that survival is the sole ethical goal of man. This relies on the premise that death is the standard of value, as against life. Survival just means avoidance of death, but death means non-existence for the living being. So a null&#x2013;a nothing&#x2013;a zero&#x2013;is being used as a guide for the something&#x2013;the thing&#x2013;the life. This is the fallacy of reification&#x2013;literally &ldquo;thing-making&rdquo;&#x2013;a nothing is being treated as a something. Death is not something that one can achieve&#x2014;at the moment of death, there is no &ldquo;one&rdquo; to speak of. Death is the end, the boundary, the non-existent as far as ethics and philosophy itself is concerned. No man can possibly have philosophy be his guide when certain death faces him. To ask what ethics has to say on a scenario where a man is moments away from death is just as valid to ask of the epistemologist how man can possibly gain any knowledge as he is enveloped by the explosion from a nuclear bomb. That man cannot gain knowledge here, does nothing to refute epistemology or ethics.

This is the same as the error implicit in Cartesian doubt. Descartes tells us that the correct way to obtain knowledge is to first doubt everything. I.e. take ignorance, falsehood, error as the primary, and from there attempt to get to knowledge, truth, understanding. Error refers to any deviation from truth, thus it cannot come *before* truth. Descartes steals the concept of error. For the same reason, death cannot act as a standard of value. Value is that which man acts to gain and/or keep&#x2014;you cannot gain or keep death. Death is the negation of existence for the living being, nothing is not something, something must be the standard, not the negation of something. So just as ignorance is not the standard of knowledge, death is not the standard of life.

In these scenarios we are presented with two choices: either commit aggression against someone, or die. They treat &ldquo;death&rdquo; as if it is an action one can take. It is not. Ethics guides man on what *actions* he should take *given the context of his life as an integrated whole*. It tells man that given he has a certain nature, certain actions are proper to him. Death is not an action. It is the end of action. We have again the reification of a zero.

This framing of ethics as guiding man on what to do given the context of his life leads us to our third problem with the framing given by the NAP-exceptionists. Namely, a misunderstanding of what &ldquo;context&rdquo; means as applied to ethics. The context of ethics is that you are a volitional being&#x2014;i.e. a lifeform capable of making choices. Ethics goes out of context if and only if you can no longer make choices. That is the situation when you can no longer count on ethics&#x2013;or even philosophy&#x2013;to guide you. Because a guide is specifically a guide to action&#x2014;a guide to choice. We are not outside of the context of ethics just because things are really scary or really dangerous&#x2014;this is precisely the moment when ethics is particularly important. It is far less urgent that one recall his principles when selecting which flavour of ice cream he should buy or which colour he should paint his wall than when he is in a life or death scenario.

This is the fourth key point: what it means to say that something is a *principle*. As Binswanger states it:

> A principle identifies an action that is required by the facts at hand. To violate a principle is to act as if what is required were not required — a contradiction. The oft-heard excuse &ldquo;Just this once&rdquo; means: &ldquo;It’s safe to accept just this one contradiction.&rdquo; But accepting a contradiction undercuts the whole structure of one’s knowledge. It forces a puzzle-piece into a space it does not fit, spoiling the overall picture (and leaving no place to put the right piece).<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>

Just as epistemic principles are what man uses for his act of validation and thus the identification of facts, ethical principles are what man uses for his identification of values. You cannot drop ethical principles &ldquo;just this once&rdquo; or &ldquo;just in emergencies&rdquo; in order to gain values&#x2014;you need those very principles to identify values in the first place. Your ethical principles are the very framework, the structure, of your hierarchy of values. It is literally impossible to identify and integrate new values if you are not operating on principle. The instant you drop the principle, you are disintegrating the entire apparatus necessary to seek and maintain objective values.

The contradiction involved redounds on the total; life becomes disintegrated on the Heraclitian premise that we are in total flux left to be guided only by negation. If I am building a very complex bridge and just cannot for the life of me work out how to make the thing work given the materials currently available. It is not proper for me to decide that just this once I will violate the principle that knowledge can be gained only by looking outwards, instead deciding I will try to contact the Platonic Form of Bridge and build based on that. If I do this, the bridge will collapse, and hopefully nobody is around when it happens.

The goal of ethics is to tell man how to live the good life. How to flourish. Not how to live the long life. To sacrifice the good life at the altar of the long life is to sacrifice life for death; to substitute the sacred for the profane.

To be sure, the fact of death is important for ethics, but not because it is the standard. Rather, death highlights why we *need* a standard in the first place. It is because you are faced with the inevitability of death that you must know how to live. &ldquo;Inevitability&rdquo; is the key word here: if ethics were truly answering the question of survival, then it would be a completely failed pursuit. Every man will die. Thus on death-as-the-standard ethics; every man is cursed with the original sin: he becomes more and more evil as he walks towards the grave&#x2014;desperately clamouring onto sustenance as he is slowly doomed to be an eternal Satan as the Platonic form of Misery. That is: the dead man is reified as the evil man, the mystic incarnation of Death. Every man is pre-determined towards this most horrid outcome. Survivalism, then, is the coating of religious afterlife myths in the language of Ayn Rand.

All of this gives license for epistemic negligence. The practical implication, is that man turns off his mind, and does not look into his available options. The second he is beset by danger, he quietly says to himself that this must be one of those emergency scenarios, and he does not bother to look for a way out. Instead, he becomes a parasite, and feasts upon the flesh of the men who did find the way out. Further: how exactly is a man to ever identify that he is in a situation where he must aggress? What is his guiding ethical principle in the situation where ethical principles no longer apply? Is man required to be omniscient in order to foresee all of the possibilities in a situation that was apparently unforseeable?

In emergencies, one is never actually presented with two options. There are innumerable different options to exhaust, none of which will be attempted if one is guided by the cowardly premise that survival is all that matters. After all, what lowlife criminal has not used the excuse that they simply had no choice but to aggress? Perhaps they had a bad upbringing, or they suffered poor socioeconomic circumstances, or they were being exploited by the capitalists? These are all wolves&rsquo; tears, and should be discarded as such.

I do not buy any of these claims from people that there is just no possible way for them to survive without becoming parasites. These claims strike me as those that could be made by the many moochers present in Ayn Rand&rsquo;s fiction. Take Hugh Glass as the paradigm example. He was enslaved to a group of pirates and was able to escape with one other gentleman. The two men found themselves in the cannibal Pawnee territory, with no map, and severely limited provisions. They were captured by the Pawnee Indians, and Hugh was forced to watch as his companion was burned alive. Before they took his life, he was able to negotiate for his life by trading exotic pigments that could be used as war paint. After being let go, Hugh would go into the fur trade, and would join a fur-trading expedition that was almost entirely wiped out by the Ree Indians. After this, he encountered a grizzly bear, which proceeded to begin tearing his flesh off and feeding him alive to her cubs. Figuring that he was sure to die, his few remaining compatriots took all of his supplies and left him for dead. He did not die. He woke up a few days later. He found that he could no longer move an arm and a leg. He crawled his way to collect supplies, still half-dead from the mauling. He would sanitise his wounds using maggots from a rotting tree stump, and after 6 months of slowly making his way down the Yellowstone river, he finally found himself at Fort Kiowa, and was able to make a recovery.

Was Hugh Glass in metaphysically abnormal circumstances? Was survival impossible to him without aggression? Apparently not.
