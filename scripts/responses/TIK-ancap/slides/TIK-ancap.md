## The Problem of Law

Given scarcity, there is a possibility for conflicts, how should we deal with these conflicts?

---

## Conflict:

mutually exclusive actions

---

## The Primitive NAP:

Do not initiate force\* \*\* \*\*\*

*or fraud
**or the threat thereof
***or other things

---

## The Mature NAP:

Do not initiate conflict

---

## Rational Law
Property rights are conflict avoiding norms

---

## How to Resolve Conflicts

1. The law of the jungle—we should not avoid conflicts;
2. mixed law—sometimes we should avoid conflicts and sometimes we should not, and;
3. the NAP—we should avoid conflicts.

## The Failure of the Mere Possessor Ethic

Ownership is *per se* distinct from possession

---

<!-- _footer: Stephan Kinsella, *Thoughts on the Latecomer and Homesteading Ideas; or, why the very idea of "ownership" implies that only libertarian principles are justifiable* -->

> [...] what is implied in the idea that the right to possess—ownership, that is—is distinct from mere possession? It means that if there is any ownership at all—and those who quarrel over things are all asserting different ownership claims and thus presupposing ownership and its distinction from possession—then *it does not accrue merely to those who take things from others*.

---

<!-- _footer: Stephan Kinsella, *Thoughts on the Latecomer and Homesteading Ideas; or, why the very idea of "ownership" implies that only libertarian principles are justifiable* -->

> That is, if B takes a thing by force from A, this cannot in and of itself make B the owner. Why? Because if it did, it means that C could take it from B, and thereby become [the] owner. But this just means there is no such thing as ownership; there is only possession. "Might makes right," so to speak. But this contradicts the presumption that ownership and possession are different.

---

<!-- _footer: Stephan Kinsella, *Thoughts on the Latecomer and Homesteading Ideas; or, why the very idea of "ownership" implies that only libertarian principles are justifiable* -->

> From this very simple idea, we see that the entire Lockean idea of first-use, first-own, follows. Why? Because if taking some good by force from its previous [possessor] is not sufficient to ground an ownership claim, then by Misesian-style "regression" it becomes obvious that only the first possessor/user can have an ownership claim. Every other person takes it from a previous possessor, and is thus a *mere possessor*—not an owner.

---

<!-- _footer: Stephan Kinsella, *Thoughts on the Latecomer and Homesteading Ideas; or, why the very idea of "ownership" implies that only libertarian principles are justifiable* -->

> The first possessor—the person who plucks the resource from its unowned state out of the commons—is the only possessor who does not take it from someone else; *this* is why *first* possession imbues the homesteader with the unique status of ownership.

## Plato's Problem of Universals

Where do universals (concepts) come from? Either:
1) there is a process that happens in the human mind to construct them from sensory data (reason);
2) they exist in the human mind from the start;
3) there is some other (mystic) means for humans to acquire new information completely independent of the senses;
4) concepts don't exist, or;
5) humans do not have epistemic access to concepts.

## Mysticism as Whim-Worship

"I think this is true because I feel like it is."

---

## The Metaphysical Basis of Mysticism

* If you *think* something to be the case hard enough then it *is* the case.
* Your consciousness is the basis of reality.

---

## The Primacy of Consciousness

---

## The Law of the Jungle as Rights-Scepticism

* On the law of the jungle there are no property rights
* Whomever is able to control a thing has done no wrong
* The jungle-lawyer cannot complain about defending property
* If he does he attributes rights to the aggressor

---

## How to Resolve Conflicts

1. The law of the jungle—we should not avoid conflicts;
2. mixed law—sometimes we should avoid conflicts and sometimes we should not, and;
3. the NAP—we should avoid conflicts.

---

## The Failure of Mixed-Law

* Arbitrary
* Debunked in *Anarcho-Capitalism: The Solution to Law*
* Could claim victory, but I can go further

---

## Hoppe's Argumentation Ethics

* Any normative proposal must be raised and decided upon in the course of an argumentation.
* There is a dispute over some scarce goods, the law of the jungle is out, so each party will be raising arguments over whether conflicts should be avoided in this instance.
* Argumentation is conflict-free, justifying as such requires you to accept the validity of non-aggression.

> [...] if there is a market for a state, then can we really deny the market? As soon as one person wants a state that need is met by the entrepreneur at which point we no longer have ancapistan and if we say no to the market wishing to found a state then we're going against the market [...]

---

<!-- _footer: MRH: Legacy's comment under TIKhistory, *Am I an Ancap? And what is Anarcho-Capitalism?* -->

> [...] can there be “market demand” for no market at all? And if so, when the market goes away as a result of this “demand” for it to go away, can there suddenly be a market demand for a market “to come back”? I suspect there is some accidental equivocation going on here—when you use the term “market” on its own, you are using it to reflect a network of voluntary interactions.

---

<!-- _footer: MRH: Legacy's comment under TIKhistory, *Am I an Ancap? And what is Anarcho-Capitalism?* -->

> When you use the term “market demand” at the end of the video, you instead seem to mean “whatever X people want”—but if some people’s property rights are being violated, then this is no longer a network of voluntary interactions; it has become something else, and is thus no longer a market at all.

---

<!-- _footer: MRH: Legacy's comment under TIKhistory, *Am I an Ancap? And what is Anarcho-Capitalism?* -->

> It’s another one of those word games Socialists will play—“So you support X—well what if I define X in THIS way, then you’d be on my side!” Substitute non-aggression in for X and the Socialists will attempt to redefine “aggression” such that it includes a man who hires a worker.

---

<!-- _footer: MRH: Legacy's comment under TIKhistory, *Am I an Ancap? And what is Anarcho-Capitalism?* -->

> Substitute consent in for X and the Socialist will attempt to redefine consent such that by living under a State you “implicitly consent” to it or something in that vein. Substitute “market” for X and the Socialist will attempt to convince you that there can be such a thing as “market demand for a State” (a social contract).

---

<!-- _footer: MRH: Legacy's comment under TIKhistory, *Am I an Ancap? And what is Anarcho-Capitalism?* -->

> Also, [if] you were to broaden what it means to be participating in a “free market” to such an extent that [the] State is said to be “demanded,” you’re locking yourself into a defense of the status quo at all times insofar as you defend markets, which isn’t much of a position at all. “The Bolsheviks took over Russia? Their ‘State’ was demanded by the people and hence was a market outcome!” and other such nonsensical positions can easily come from this.
