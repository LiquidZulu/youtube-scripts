#+TITLE: How Postmodernism is Self-Defeating

* Intro
Hello, today's #Short video is an adaptation of Anglo Libertarian's demonstration of the self defeating nature of postmodernism.

* Syllogism
** postmodernist premises
+ postmodernism posits that one cannot derive truth claims from social constructs
+ language is a social construct
** deductions
+ given P1 and P2 you cannot make truth claims using language
+ P1 and P2 are truth claims using language
** conclusion
+ therefore postmodernism is built on inconsistent premises

* outro
