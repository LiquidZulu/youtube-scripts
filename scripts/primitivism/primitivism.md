## Unabomber manifesto <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XITtGGrKMU>

Industrial revolution has been a disaster because even though you get a longer nominal life expectancy (due to reduced infant mortality mainly) you have:

1.  a destabilised society
2.  unfulfilling life
3.  human indignity
4.  psychological suffering
5.  severe natural damage
6.  physical suffering in the 3rd world

Therefore the only ethical response to this is a revolution against the (industrial) system, not a political revolution changing political policies or parties in charge leaving the technological basis in tact, but a revolution against Modern Technology specifically (why did he capitalise this?).

[this video got very boring and was talking about things outside of primitivism proper so I stopped watching]


<a id="orgd5af9f3"></a>

## Anarcho-Primitivism <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex55jjSASHA>

Three standard arguments:

1.  re-appraisal of hunter-gatherer life (this one is not particularly relevant to my argument)
2.  environmental impact of civilisation
3.  how civilisation causes loss of liberty and autonomy


<a id="org7d4db9d"></a>

### Re-appraisal of hunter-gatherer life

Traditional view, as stated by Hobbes, is that life in a state of nature is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. Every day is spent toiling just to survive.

This isnt true because anthropologists said it wasnt actually too bad (I dont need to go into this).


<a id="org1b9c005"></a>

### Environmental impact of civilisation

The cost of the increased standard of living from civilisation comes in the form of damage to the environment (climate change, ocean acidification, deforestation, topsoil depletion, pollution in the air and water, massive biodiversity loss, introduction of invasive species). Therefore civilisation as we know it cannot continue.


<a id="org6cac4c4"></a>

### Technology and autonomy

All anarchists can recognise that technology in modern society is (&rsquo;can be&rsquo; would be better) used to restrict our liberties and enforce hierarchical power structures (he doesnt understand that anarchism isnt opposed to hierarchy).

The standard view is that technology isnt per se bad, but that it can be used for either good or bad things. Primitivists respond by saying that there are inherent problems with technology, and that reforming civilisation fails to address these fundamental problems. Civilisation is based on the domestication of natural items, the natural world is reduced to a collection of resources for human use (this is required by action).

The domestication of nature extends to humans; just as domestic animals are different to their wild counterparts so too are humans&#x2014;humans are made into tools to sustain civilisation rather than being autonomous beings. Civilisation is a means of dominating the natural world and you cannot use a means of domination for the end of achieving liberation. This is the prefigurative principle: the means used in a political struggle must reflect the ends that you are trying to achieve. (this ignores that nature being dominated by man does not contradict with man not being dominated)

Primitivists draw a distinction between tools and technology&#x2014;a tool is an object made by a single individual, or the cooperation of many individuals on a single occasion. Technology, on the other hand, consists of objects produced by &ldquo;large-scale interlocking systems of extraction, production, distribution, and consumption.&rdquo; First it is the nature of such systems that they &ldquo;gain their own momentum,&rdquo; such that individuals have no control, nor even any understanding of them. (he is just talking about higher-order capital goods lol&#x2014;how high level must a capital good be before it is no longer a tool but a technology?)

Consider cars, initially when they were invented it would seemingly give people more freedom as they can now move about more easily&#x2014;but over time traffic laws had to be developed and now they must obey those laws (is your freedom infringed by agreeing to the rules of a game of chess?). To sustain a technological society people must keep constructing it and consuming its products, thus their behaviour must be rigidly controlled (lmao, they are agreeing to engage in a division of labour).


<a id="org0166099"></a>

### Critique of Symbolic Thought

The problems of domestication and loss of autonomy begin with symbolic thought, our concepts are constructed by our minds tand then these are used to structure our experience and make it open to manipulation. Symbolic thought replaces real, immediate experience with abstract, constructed representation. &ldquo;Let A stand for X&rdquo; as opposed to letting A be A and X be X&#x2014;this causes us to lose touch with authentic reality. Symbolic thought reduces freedom because you have to use systems of symbols constructed by others (make your own damn symbols if it upsets you so much lmao).

Waa waa I&rsquo;m a baby and I&rsquo;m upset that vision is seen as the primary sense (I wonder if that has something to do with our big fuck-off visual cortexes?). Symbolic thought carves up the senses&#x2013;vision is separated from the other senses (???)&#x2013;and then places vision atop a hierarchy, and the other senses are suppressed (and the evidence for this is, of course, that sometimes we use visual metaphors). Vision transforms the person into a spectator&#x2014;vision presents objects with intrinsic properties, separate from me (so now he doesnt like self-awareness??? And why is *he* now putting vision on a pedestal? Am I a spectator in smell too?).


<a id="org6559027"></a>

### Primitivism is Incoherent

Yadda yadda contradiction in proposing primitivism over the internet&#x2014;this is unfair because all anarchists are forced to participate in oppressive systems (you have a god damn choice of whether you want to engage in the division of labour, I choose to never aggress, if you think technology is bad for you then choose to not engage in it&#x2014;christ!).

## Introduction

Primitivism is a philosophy based upon the destruction of human civilisation, and is therefore the complete rejection of any manner of human ethic. It is most notably advanced by Ted Kaczynski, and has for far too long been allowed to thrive and receive praise from various online edge-lords. These commentators will often spout nonsense about how Ted was actually right about many things. It is the goal of this video to demonstrate that the philosophy of primitivism in all its form is ethically and economically incoherent, in its anti-human beliefs.

Primitivists make three main arguments:

1.  First, they say that the hunter-gatherer lifestyle wasn&rsquo;t as bad as people make it out to be
2.  Second, they contend that civilisation has a negative impact on the environment, making it immoral
3.  Third, they say that civilisation causes a loss of liberty and autonomy.

This video will address all of these, and more, so make sure you stick it out till the end to really round out your understanding&#x2014;I promise it wont be boring.


<a id="org1f189f4"></a>

## Technology and the Apocalypse

In his economic magnum opus&#x2013;Man, Economy, and State&#x2013;Rothbard describes technology as recipes a man uses to determine how to use means to arrive at ends. For instance, if Robinson Crusoe knows that using a net will allow him to catch more fish than otherwise, the knowledge of this and of how to build such a net would be a technology that he possesses in his mind, the actual implementation of this would be in the form of creating the capital good of a net. Capital goods are those goods that a man uses to attain other goods, for the case of a fish, the net is a capital good that gets him a further capital good of raw fish, that he may then combine with a capital good of a fire to create the consumers good&#x2013;cooked fish&#x2013;that he may then enjoy directly.

In the above example, the raw fish and the fire may be classed as first-order capital goods, as they are one step removed from the consumers good. The net on the other hand is known as a second-order capital good, as it is two steps removed from the consumers good. In a large division of labour, many higher order capital goods are used in the production of many different consumers goods. The level of development of a given society is best seen as how high this hierarchy of capital goods rises.

Primitivists detract from this standard economic language&#x2014;they draw a distinction between technology and tools. As John Moore describes,<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> the primitivist sees a tool on the one hand as an object made by a single individual, or the cooperation of many individuals on a single occasion and on the other hand technology as objects produced by &ldquo;large-scale interlocking systems of extraction, production, distribution, and consumption.&rdquo; I think this is best translated into sound economic terms as tools being lower-order capital goods, and technologies being higher-order capital goods. Moore explains that the primitivist is against only technologies and not tools. The primitivist contends that the large systems that higher-order capital goods gives rise to &ldquo;gain their own momentum,&rdquo; such that individuals have no control, nor even any understanding of them. This begs the question of how high order must a capital good be before it transitions from tool into technology&#x2014;if this is a continuum problem where no hard-set line can be found, I ask what exactly is the principled difference between a lower-order and a higher-order capital goods? It&rsquo;s certainly the case that different men are able to understand the capital structure to different degrees, is it that the second you are no longer able to understand all the cogs at play in the division of labour that it becomes impersonal and thus immoral to engage with it? That would be the complete rejection of the very purpose of the division of labour&#x2014;its remarkable ability to allow men to specialise into those tasks that they are best at, allowing everyone to benefit from their superior efficiency.

It is from this note that the only coherent framing of anti-technology is anti-capital goods that we arrive at what makes primitivism an apocalyptic ideology. But before I go into that I ask that you hit the like button if you want to see more takedowns of evil ideologies.

So, an apocalypse is simply a mass-breakdown of capital goods, consider any apocalypse story you have read or movie you have watched, the character of what makes it an apocalypse is not mass death, or scary monsters or anything like that&#x2014;it&rsquo;s the breakdown of the capital structure that has allowed civilisation to thrive and thus fall upon said breakdown. Station Eleven is the perfect example of this, it&rsquo;s a story about a pandemic that wipes out over 90% of the worlds population, and focuses heavily on the afetrmath of this event. You see the characters walking through ruined cityscapes, and throughout the show this is contrasted with entire b-plots detailing the life before.

It is often the case that many humans do die in such tales, but this is not the *essence* of what makes it an apocalype, that essence is in the breakdown of our very way of life, turning from a world of comfort and joy to one of scavenging and survival. It is also reasonable enough to re-frame this as a mass-breakdown of the division of labour, rather than as capital goods specifically, if you desire to maintain mass-death in your definition of apocalype, and under this the conclusion remains&#x2014;primitivism is apocalyptic.


<a id="orgd5c7105"></a>

## The Environment and Anti-Human non-Ethics

The primitivist claim that human civilisation is detrimental to the environment and thus immoral can be summarised as follows; there is an associated cost to the increased standard of living provided by civilisation that comes in the form of damage to the environment; climate change, ocean acidification, deforestation, topsoil depletion, etc&#x2014;this damage, they say, is an immoral action and humans should not take from the environment for their own betterment.

This is the crux of their anti-Humanism, in the vein of the conservationist subversion that has taken hold of the environmentalist movement. Conservationism is the philosophy of preserving the non-human environment at all costs, true environmentalism recognises that the reason we care about the environment is because we are a part of it&#x2014;it&rsquo;s nakedly anti-human to ignore human wellbeing in your analysis of the health of the environment.

Moreover, this is why I denote primitivism an non-Ethic, as it completely ignores the issue that ethics is there to solve&#x2014;how should humans live their lives? In short, a human ethic must satisfy two properties; (1) universilisation&#x2014;it has to apply to all of mankind, and (2) it must actually assure the survival of mankind, as there is no point in concerning yourself with what a human ethic should be if no humans are alive.

Primitivism satisfies our first condition, but fails on the second because to state that any taking from the natural world by men should not be done is a call for human extinction. It is impossible to advocate such a thing as it would be negated by its very advocacy&#x2014;to argue that humans may not appropriate anything from nature is to argue that they may not act, as all men require that they be able to appropriate scarce nature-given goods that they may implement as means. It is obvious that not being able to appropriate anything from nature locks one in a standstill, they cannot eat as that would require appropriating food, they cannot breathe as that would require appropriating air, even by simply standing they are appropriating that standing room, making this an impossible ethic to comply with in the first place.

Finally, I shall go over the areas listed above and see how much it is the case that any issues related to them are the result of society, or the destructive effects levied against society by the state. First, climate change, this is the favourite &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; of watermelons across the globe&#x2014;the associated danger with it is monumentally overstated by those with utterly no understanding of economics. As Shellenberger explains:<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>

> Scientists had a similarly negative reaction to the extreme claims made by Extinction Rebellion. Stanford University atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira, one of the first scientists to raise the alarm about ocean acidification, stressed that “while many species are threatened with extinction, climate change does not threaten human extinction.”<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> MIT climate scientist Kerry Emanuel told me, “I don’t have much patience for the apocalypse criers. I don’t think it’s helpful to describe it as an apocalypse.”<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>
> 
> An AOC spokesperson told Axios, “We can quibble about the phraseology, whether it’s existential or cataclysmic.” But, he added, “We’re seeing lots of [climate change–related] problems that are already impacting lives.”<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>
> 
> But if that’s the case, the impact is dwarfed by the 92 percent decline in the decadal death toll from natural disasters since its peak in the 1920s. In that decade, 5.4 million people died from natural disasters. In the 2010s, just 0.4 million did.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> Moreover, that decline occurred during a period when the global population nearly quadrupled.
> 
> In fact, both rich and poor societies have become far less vulnerable to extreme weather events in recent decades. In 2019, the journal Global Environmental Change published a major study that found death rates and economic damage dropped by 80 to 90 percent during the last four decades, from the 1980s to the present.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>
> 
> While global sea levels rose 7.5 inches (0.19 meters) between 1901 and 2010,<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup> the IPCC estimates sea levels will rise as much as 2.2 feet (0.66 meters) by 2100 in its medium scenario, and by 2.7 feet (0.83 meters) in its high-end scenario. Even if these predictions prove to be significant underestimates, the slow pace of sea level rise will likely allow societies ample time for adaptation.

The other three, ocean acidification, deforestation, topsoil depletion, are all trivially solved by private property rights, in the oceans, forests, and soil respectively. If I am allowed to own a patch of ocean, I will want to keep it in good nick&#x2014;hard to get much money from a big vat of death where nothing can live. It is the fault of state forestalling of these public possessions that is the cause here, not any inherenet flaw in society.


<a id="org22ef7ee"></a>

## Domestication

The standard, and correct, view is that technology itself isn&rsquo;t per se bad but rather can be used for either good or bad things. Primitivists respond to this by saying that there are inherent problems with technology, and that reforming civilisation fails to address these fundamental problems.

The argument starts by pointing out that civilisation is based on the domestication of natural items, i.e. the natural world is reduced to a collection of resources for human use, which is correct and in fact a pre-requisite of human action. Where the primitivist argument slips up here though is in asserting that this domestication extends to humans as well; just as domestic animals are different to their wild counterparts, so too are humans&#x2014;humans are made into tools to sustain civilisation rather than being autonomous beings. This makes no sense whatsoever. The key distinction between domestic animals and humans engaged in a division of labour is that the humans choose to engage in society and therefore must prefer it to the alternative&#x2014;they necessarily benefit from this interaction by their own estimation.

Primitivists further this argument by use of the prefigurative principle, which states that the means used in some political struggle cannot contradict with the ends that you are trying to achieve, which I wholeheartedly agree with. They misapply this principle in stating that civilisation is a means of dominating the natural world and that you cannot use a tool of domination to achieve liberation. This, again, suffers from conflating humans and non-humans; civilisation is certainly a means of domination over nature, as much as that makes sense, but it is explicitly not a tool of domination over other humans. Such acts of domination over others are statist in nature, in other words they are actively anti-civilisation. As Hoppe has shown,<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup> the state in its expropriation of productive individuals engages in necessarily de-civilising activities, namely, expropriation of producers, homesteaders, and traders enacts a tendency away from production, homesteading, and trade. But it is precicely those activities that make up the division of labour and therefore form the cornerstone of society.

To finalise the argument, I revisit the discussion above of the primitivist distinction between tools and technology, where it is stated that technology, as opposed to tools, &ldquo;gain their own momentum.&rdquo; Kane B gives the example of cars, initially when they were invented it would seemingly give people more freedom as they can now move about more easily, that is they can better attain their ends. But over time traffic laws had to be developed and the car owners had to obey these laws, which it is condended is apparently a violation of freedom. To which I ask whether my freedom is violated if I agree to play by the rules of chess? Certainly not, it is my decision that I want to engage in this mutually beneficial interaction with another man. Similarly for cars. In a just society, all roads would be either privately owned or abandoned to nature. In the case of abandoned roads there is no interaction but also no rules of the road. It is only in private roads where just rules may be enacted, but this is an interaction with the owner of the road. Just as my rights are not violated by a woman refusing to have sex with me unless I buy her dinner first they are equally not violated by a road owner refusing to allow me on his road unless I agree by certain codes of conduct on said road.

## Outro

To cap off this video, I open the floor to any supposed primitivists who wish to respond to me over The Internet&#x2014;possibly the most advanced technology known to man. Say, I wonder if that would violate some sort of prefigurative principle? Who knows. In any case if you enjoyed you have to watch this video where I provide a similar takedown of minarchist thought, which will allow you to trounce those suckers too.

[Fading out at the end] *honestly, I dont know why people think this ted guy is so smart* [some sort of ted jumpscare or meme?]
