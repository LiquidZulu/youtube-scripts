* Introduction
This is a meme you will often be sent when debating with international-socialists, so much that it is taken as true even by supporters of liberty. But is this the case? Let us look at what Wolff is saying in this clip and see if it lines up with the etymylogical reality of socialism.

* What Wolff is saying socialism is and is not
** 39:41[fn:1]
*** Quote
#+begin_quote
We have a mass of people, most Americans, who think that socialism has something to do with the government being in charge. No... thats not the idea. The idea was to get the government because with that power you could then make the transition. It wouldn't /be/ the transition --- it would be the step that would /allow/ you to make the transition. What would the transition be? Let's go back; to reorganise enterprises, factories, offices, stores, so that they would work in the interests of the whole community because the whole community would be making the decisions.

*** Analysis
Ok let's look at what he is saying here;
#+begin_quote
We have a mass of people, most Americans, who think that socialism has something to do with the government being in charge. No... thats not the idea.
#+end_quote
So in this first section he is saying that (1) socialism has /nothing/ to do with the government being in charge.

#+begin_quote
The idea was to get the government because with that power you could then make the transition.
#+end_quote
Ok but here he is saying that (2) you need to take control of the government to make the transition, so socialism clearly /does/ have something to do with the government being in charge or else it wouldnt have "that power" that Wolff's socialism requires.

#+begin_quote
It wouldn't /be/ the transition --- it would be the step that would /allow/ you to make the transition. What would the transition be? Let's go back; to reorganise enterprises, factories, offices, stores, so that they would work in the interests of the whole community because the whole community would be making the decisions.
#+end_quote
Yes and how would you go about all this reorganising? With "that power" that the government weilds, this /is/ something to do with the government being in charge, this is /not/ a system where the government leaves people alone --- leave alone, also known as laissez faire is what /capitalism/ provides, socialism is inherently opposed to laissez faire and is therefore inherently in favour of government intervention.

*** Quote
#+begin_quote
The question was; "did the state transform the economy," and the answer is no. They didn't. Not becuse they're bad and not because theyre stupid or nothing like that. This is the way the history worked out --- it's an understandible thing.
#+end_quote
*** Analysis
Wolff's point here appears to be that /because/ the state failed to transform the economy in the way he wants that socialism isn't statist, not even the argument that the specific state he is talking about, the USSR, wasn't socialist which would also be an easy claim to argue against. You can say any number of things about any individual state one could imagine and you can say that they aren't socialist for reasons x, y and z but that does asolutely nothing to further the idea that socialism has /nothing/ to do with statism.

** 40:52[fn:3]
*** Quote
#+begin_quote
Poor Stalin. Well he had to go to the Russian people who had sacraficed unspeakable [sic] in their lives. And what was he going to say to them? "Thank you very much, you've sacraficed unbelievably now for the last 15 years," it's 1930, "since the revolution, I'm glad to announce to you all that what we have acheived is... state-capitalism. We've got a-whole-nother sacrafice for god knows how many years to get to...". They would have ridden him out of town on a rail. He couldn't... so he did what politicians do --- he substituted the wish for the reality. "We've made it; we're here --- socialism is when the government does stuff, and it's more socialism the more stuff it does, and when it does a real lotta stuff; its communism."
#+end_quote
*** Analysis
We have made it indeed, so the meme quote is a parody of stalin redefining socialism to what the USSR was doing. The argument Wolff is making here will fall apart if only I could show "state-capitalism" to be an oxymoron, which I do below, for now I will give my definition's of socialism, capitalism and much more and I will give a breif explanation of where they come from and I will cite my sources for that definition --- predominently the Oxford English dictionary.

* Episteme
** Private
*** Definition
Belonging to or for the use of one particular person[fn:4][fn:5][fn:6]
*** Origin
Latin /privus/, 'single, individual'[fn:7]
** Public
*** Definition
Of or concerning the people as a whole[fn:8][fn:9][fn:10]
*** Origin
Latin /publicus/, 'of the state'[fn:11][fn:12]
** Common
*** Definition
Belonging to or invoving the whole of a community or the public at large[fn:13][fn:14][fn:15]
** Group
*** Definition

** Nation
*** Definition
A large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular state or territory[fn:17][fn:18][fn:19]
** Private/Free Market
*** Definition
A society without conflict[fn:20][fn:21]
*** Explanation
[[Private]] individuals engaging in voulntary interaction
** Private Sector
*** Definition
1. The part of the national economy that is not under the direct control of the state[fn:22][fn:23][fn:24][fn:25]
2. Businesses and industries that are not owned or controlled by the government[fn:22][fn:23][fn:24][fn:25]
*** Notes
In a [[Private/Free Market]] this would be all there is and as such a market would consist of small firms with massive competition as massive corporations only survive thanks to parasitic government aid. The reason this is is due to the increased difficulty of internal calculations due to the lack of an internal market in the company. For more on this see my work on the topic [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-391URcYL7s][here]] and [[https://github.com/LiquidZulu/youtube-scripts/blob/main/scripts/natural-monopoly/natural-monopoly.org][here]].
** Public Sector
*** Definition
The subset of the economy that is under government control[fn:26][fn:27]
** Capitalism
*** Definition
1. [[Private]] control of the [[Means of Production]][fn:28][fn:29][fn:30][fn:31]
2. an economic and political system in which trade and industry are controlled by [[Private]] owners, rather than by the state[fn:28][fn:29][fn:30][fn:31]

*** notes
Prior to Lenin Communism was synonymous with [[Socialism]][fn:40]
Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer ~= One Class, One State, One Comrade
** Means of Production
*** Definition
1. Physical assets that a company uses in the production process to manufacture products and services that consumers will later use. Capital goods include buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, and tools. Capital goods are not finished goods, instead, they are used to make finished goods[fn:41]
2. (in Marxist theory) The raw materials and means of labour (tools, machines, etc) employed in the production process[fn:42]
3. (in Marxist theory) The combination of the means of labor--such as machines, tools, and equipment--and the subject of labor used by workers to make products[fn:43]
*** Notes
Synonymous with "capital goods"
** Marxism
*** Definition
Marxism is a social, political, and economic philosophy named after Karl Marx. It examines the effect of capitalism on labor, productivity, and economic development and argues for a worker revolution to overturn capitalism in favor of communism. Marxism posits that the struggle between social classes -- specifically between the bourgeoisie, or capitalists, and the proletariat, or workers -- defines economic relations in a capitalist economy and will inevitably lead to revolutionary communism[fn:44]
** Economy
*** Definition
1. The organisation of the resources of a community[fn:45]
2. The system by which a given society allocates scarce resources[fn:46]

* Arguments and counterarguments

** Marxism is a subset of socialism, not the other way around
Often people will conflate [[Socialism]] and [[Marxism]], Wolff does this constantly in the previously referenced clips, this is a subversive view that has taken root thanks to the overtly Frankfurt and Keynesian influenced lens taught to most people[fn:47]. But it is not the case --- Marx and Engles built their communism on a long history of prior thinkers[fn:48][fn:49][fn:50][fn:51], Marx himself believed that primitive man practiced [[Marxism]][fn:52], implying this history even /within/ marxist thought. Over the centuries that built socialism the ideas of social control over the means of production would spawn many ideologoies, Marxism, National-Socialism, Syndicalism -- which became fascism[fn:53] -- and many more, the common feature of them all is that they are all statist in nature, which I will show now.

** Socialism is Statism
Per our definition -- corroborated by 3 separate mainstream dictionaries[fn:54] -- [[Socialism]] is, outside of [[Marxism]], defined as; [[Group]] control of the [[Economy]]/[[Means of Production]]. Now this [[Group]] can be any number of things, it can be the workers, or the Volk, or soviets, but the defining feature is it has control over the [[Economy]] or the [[Means of Production]]. So this group necessarily must control the [[Public Sector]], which is controlled by the government (it is nonsensical to attempt to describe [[Group]] control of that which is [[Private]]). So the [[Group]] that controls the economy, the subset that it has control over being the [[Public Sector]], is the government, or the state. So by our mainstream definitions a society is socialist to the extent that there is a [[Public Sector]] and capitalist to the extent that there is a [[Private Sector]]. Statism /is/ socialism, socialism /is/ statism.

** State Capitalim
To carry on from this we can now see that "state capitalism" is oxymoronic --- capitalism being [[Private]] control of the [[Means of Production]] so the [[Private Sector]] is the subset of the economy that is capitalist in nature. And further that; a [[Private/Free Market]] would be one where the entire economy is the [[Private Sector]], it would be Laissez-Faire or "leave alone," in this free-market any existence of coercion or aggression, that is any actions that cuase a conflict, will be perversions of the market, giving the definition above. This all means that capitalism is explicitly non-state in the same way that socialism is explicitly state. So "state capitalism" essentially means "state-non state."
