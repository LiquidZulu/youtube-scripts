* Notes
+ the DailyWire's media strategy seems to be the same as those knockoffs dvd companies that would throw a bunch of nonsense ripoffs in the dollar bin at Walmart to trick your grandmother into thinking she is buying something else.
+ the DailyWire political strategy wrt the culture war here is on the same level as like "Ghost Busters, but they're WOMEN."
  + "This is a CONSERVATIVE movie" as against just making a good movie that happens to be conservative.
