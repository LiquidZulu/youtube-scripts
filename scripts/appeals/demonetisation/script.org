#+title: Demonetisation Appeal

* Introduction
Hello, the monetisation for my channel was recently revoked under the "Reused content" policy and this decision has been made in error. I was unable to make the appeal deadline previously and thus I was forced to re-apply for monetisation, in preparation for the re-application I deleted many of the videos on my channel that could be interpreted to contain excessive reused content.

[slide showing youtube support]Based upon advice from this support chat [slide showing article] and this Google Support article I will demonstrate why the /vast/ majority of the content on my channel does not fall under the "Reused content" policy.

[slide showing analysis performed]I performed an analysis of all of my videos uploaded on the date that my application for monetisation was rejected and sorted the videos into different buckets corresponding to the video type (i.e. whether they were a stream, a short or a regular video), and the genre of video in question (i.e. whether it is meme content or more video-essay focused). I then also went through and categorised the videos based on the level of reused content, sorted into heavy (meaning the video had a lot of reused content), light (meaning it had very little but still some), and none (meaning there was not a second of unoriginal content in the video).

[videoType-pie]This chart shows the proportion of content sorted by video type---you will notice that the vast majority is taken up by livestreamed content, and my livestreams do not reuse any content from other people, they rather consist of me talking to people. [videoType-bar]This can also be seen in a bar chart of the same data.

[genre-pie]This chart shows the content broken down into my subjective categorisation, here it is clear that debate content is my focus, and the debate content does not consist of any reused content from elsewhere, it is made by me engaging in a debate with some other person or other people. The next largest category is my video-essay content, labelled "thesis" here. [genre-bar]And again, here is a bar chart showing the same data.

[reuse-pie]Now we can come to the level of reused content per the YouTube monetisation policies. The "heavy" slice is so small that Google sheets did not even label it, [reuse-bar]so you can see the quantity on this bar chart. It is clear that the /vast/ majority of my content is not reused, which is clear given my channel strategy is focused heavily on debate and video essay content, the former contains no reused content and the latter reuses content only sparingly for the purpose of responding to points that others have made and to cite points that others have made.

[slide showing Reused content policy]The Reused content policy has revision of content and clips for the purpose of review under the examples of what can be monetised. It is on these grounds that I argue that my channel does not violate the Reused content policy:
+ the vast majority of my content has no reused content, and;
+ those videos of mine that do reuse content either make up a tiny fraction of my channel (as is the case for meme videos) or do so sparingly and for the purpose of review or revision.

[ADDING THIS]

I spend a great deal of time writing, filming, and editing my videos. I use a program called doom emacs to write the scripts, all of which can be found on my github. I film my videos with OBS studio and edit them with kdenlive. This very appeal has been made by recording audio with audacity and editing together slides generated by a program called Marp---and the source code for all of this is up on my github so you can see for yourself that I have been consistently writing, editing, and filming content for this channel for years.

[/ADDING THIS]

[thank you slide]I trust that I have made clear that my channel is not dedicated to compiling clips from others and that this appeal should thus succeed. Thank you and have a nice day.
