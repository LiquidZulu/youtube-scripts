* Notes
** David Friedman on Property Rights, http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Property/Property.html
+ He lays forth two types of rights:
  + Moral: "The fact that I have a right to do something is an argument, although not necessarily a sufficient argument, that someone who prevents me from doing it is acting wrongly."
  + (Positive) Legal: From the legal standpoint, rights are a description either of what the law says or of how it is enforced. On the latter interpretation, "I have a right to do X" translates as something like "If I do X the police will not arrest me; if someone tries to stop me from doing X the police will arrest him."
+ He says these are not the correct way to think about rights, "We frequently observe behavior which looks like the claiming of rights and the recognition of rights in contexts where neither a moral nor a legal account seems relevant."
  + For this he cites Great Britain's "right" to control Hong Kong, "It is difficult to explain Communist China's willingness to respect that right on legal grounds, given that, from the Maoist standpoint, neither the government of Britain nor previous, non-communist governments with which it had signed agreements were entities entitled to any moral respect. It seems equally difficult to explain it on legal grounds, given the general weakness of international law and the fact that for part of the period in question Great Britain (as a member state of the United Nations) was at war with China. An alternative explanation‚Äîthat the Chinese government believed that British occupation of Hong Kong was in its own interest‚Äîseems inconsistent with the Chinese failure to renew the lease on the New Territories, due to expire in 1997."
+ "A further difficulty with moral accounts of rights, in particular of property rights, is the degree to which the property rights that people actually respect seem to depend on facts that are morally irrelevant. This difficulty presents itself in libertarian accounts of property as the problem of initial acquisition. It is far from clear even in principle how unowned resources such as land can become private property. Even if one accepts an account, such as that of Locke, of how initial acquisition might justly have occurred, that account provides little justification for the existing pattern of property rights, given the high probability that any piece of property has been unjustly seized at least once since it was first cleared. Yet billions of people, now and in the past, base much of their behavior on respect for property claims that seem either morally arbitrary or clearly unjust."
+ "For all of these reasons, I believe it is worth attempting a positive account of rights‚Äîan account which is both amoral and alegal. In part I of this essay I present such an account‚Äîone in which rights, in particular property rights, are a consequence of strategic behavior and may exist with no moral or legal support."
  + he is not providing any legal ethic, rather just describing a sort of game theoretic description of when people aggress and when they dont, sans any underlying property theory to even understand what is aggression and what isnt

#+begin_quote
In thinking about issues of rights, I find myself playing two quite different roles. As a human being and (like all human beings) an amateur philosopher, I have moral intuitions; from that standpoint, the question is "why ought one not to steal" and the answer is "because it is wicked." As an economist I ask and answer different questions. One is "what are the consequences of people being free to steal." Much of the economic analysis of law is devoted to answering questions of that sort. Another is "why do people (often) not steal?"

This essay is an attempt to answer that final sort of question. I have tried to answer the economist's question about rights rather than the philosopher's not because economics is more important than moral philosophy but because I am more confident in my ability to use economics to produce answers.[21] I have been encouraged in this policy by a curious and convenient coincidence: in most cases, the rules I conclude to be efficient are also the rules I believe to be just.
#+end_quote
+ so there is no david friedmanite legal philosophy, which he fully accepts, therefore it is odd when people take these analyses and apply them to ethical discussions.
  + on a related note, as there is no david friedmanite legal philosophy, there can be no corressponding position on anarchism vs statism, as the question of anarchism vs statism is not a positive one, but a normative one---we must analyse the anarchist as opposed to the statist ethic, rather than analysing the positive effects of these systems. This is because even if we do all the hard work at demonstrating that an unhampered market leads to a greater standard of living in the long run, we lack any corresponding reason as to why this makes it better, not only will this be entirely unconvincing to the high time preference man (https://mises.org/library/duty-natural-outlaws-shut), but even to low time preference people who would therefore have to prefer anarchism to statism we fail to demonstrate that we /should/ be anarchists as opposed to statists. Rather we have retreated into legal whim-worshipping---that our argument is of the form "you should be an anarchist because you would prefer it." But the fact that some set of people would prefer it does not imply that they should be anarchists, it may well be the case that John would prefer to rape Jane than to not rape her, but this does not imply that he /should/ rape her, it is in fact the case that he /should not/ rape her.

#+begin_quote
/A government is an agency of legitimized coercion./ I define 'coercion', for the purposes of this definition, as the violation of what people in a particular society believe to be the rights of individuals with respect to other individuals.

[...]

The special characteristic that distinguishes governments from other agencies of coercion (such as ordinary criminal gangs) is that most people accept government coercion as normal and proper. The same act that is regarded as coercive when done by a private individual seems legitimate if done by an agent of the government.

If I yell 'Stop, thief!' at a stickup man escaping with my wallet, the bystanders may or may not help, but they will at least recognize the reasonableness of my act. If I yell 'Stop, thief!' at an employee of the Internal Revenue Service, leaving my house after informing me that he has just frozen my bank account, my neighbors will think I'm crazy. Objectively, the IRS is engaged in the same act as the thief. It seizes my resources without my permission. True, it claims to provide me with services in exchange for my taxes, but it insists on collecting the taxes whether or not I want the services. It is, perhaps, a fine point whether that is robberyor extortion. In either case, if it were the act of a private party, everyone would agree that it was a crime.
#+end_quote
+ this is an absurd definition of coercion and would allow for any manner of insane actions to be labelled 'non-coercive' by virtue of a positive outlook from the public. Moreover, if that is what coercion means then Friedmans further assertion that the IRS is engaged in the same act as the theif is incorrect---the action is different in that it is not coercive due to positive public opinion, people think that you do not have the right to resist taxes

** Introduction
[maybe start with clip of david friedmanite saying something ridiculous with a background boom (max fosh boom) to cut to black?]

David Friedman is not an ancap, in fact he can scarcely even be described as an anarchist. This will likely come as a shock to many; Friedman takes centre stage in introductory videos to anarcho-capitalism, appearing as one of the faces of the movement to outsiders. But this portrayal could not be further from the truth, and I will show you exactly why.

** What is Anarcho-Capitalism
First, I must explain what Anarcho-Capitalism even is. Anarchism in general refers to the set of philosophies centering around the prohibition of rulers, but what exactly it means to be a ruler differs between schools of thought. Proto-anarchists lacked a strong scientific basis for their convictions as to what counted as voluntary and involuntary, thus Proudhon and his peers would decry wage labour as a form of coercion that would be absent in a free society, and even more recent anarchist philosophers such as Lysander Spooner relied on an imprecise basis for their anarchism, which is where Murray Rothbard comes in with his new Anarcho-*Capitalism*:[fn:1]
#+begin_quote
I am, therefore, strongly tempted to call myself an "individualist anarchist," except for the fact that Spooner and Tucker have in a sense preempted that name for their doctrine and that from that doctrine I have certain differences. Politically, these differences are minor, and therefore the system that I advocate is very close to theirs; but economically, the differences are substantial...
#+end_quote

Those substantial differences in economics come about due to Murray Rothbards adherence to the Austrian school of economics along with its science of human action, praxeology. Praxeology provides the stable and precise grounding for anarchist philosophy that was previously missing.

** Anarchism vs David Friedmanism on Law
Of note here is that anarchism as no-rulersism is specifically a position on law; that is, it is a position on the proper way to resolve conflict. An anarchist necessarily has to give precedence to the non-ruler over the ruler in any given conflict, which is a normative position---the non-ruler /ought/ win the conflict. Here, we say that the non-ruler has the property right. David Friedman has a different approach to law,[fn:2] stating two types of rights; moral and legal. A moral right to do X, says Friedman, "... is an argument, although not a necessarily sufficient argument, that someone who prevents me from doing it is acting wrongly." This moral right does not correspond with property rights in anarchism as they do not imply anything with respect to justice, so we move to Friedman's legal rights:
#+begin_quote
From the legal standpoint, rights are a description either of what the law says or of how it is enforced. On the latter interpretation, "I have a right to do X" translates as something like "If I do X the police will not arrest me; if someone tries to stop me from doing X the police will arrest him."
#+end_quote

Friedman sees both his legal and moral rights as being insufficient to describe the full nature of property rights, which I wholeheartedly agree with. But he errs in then jumping to a positive account of rights, "an account which is both amoral and alegal. ... one in which rights, in particular property rights, are a consequence of strategic behavior and may exist with no moral or legal support." This account amounts to essentially a theory describing when people aggress and when they don't, which is flawed in the outset as it lacks any underlying property theory to even understand what is aggression and what is non-aggression. So even if we grant him the ground that he is correct that people aggress when he predicts they will, we still must have a natural law backing for his theory to work; this legal backing provides an objective theory of property rights that is antecedent to any discussion of when people respect those rights.

Unfortunately, Friedman does not make explicit what property theory he is using in the background. He goes on:
#+begin_quote
In thinking about issues of rights, I find myself playing two quite different roles. As a human being and [...] an amateur philosopher, I have moral intuitions; from that standpoint, the question is "why ought one not to steal" and the answer is "because it is wicked." As an economist I ask and answer different questions. One is "what are the consequences of people being free to steal." Much of the economic analysis of law is devoted to answering questions of that sort. Another is "why do people (often) not steal?"

This essay is an attempt to answer that final sort of question. I have tried to answer the economist's question about rights rather than the philosopher's not because economics is more important than moral philosophy but because I am more confident in my ability to use economics to produce answers. I have been encouraged in this policy by a curious and convenient coincidence: in most cases, the rules I conclude to be efficient are also the rules I believe to be just.
#+end_quote
Here, Friedman outright states that his analysis is only to be taken as an economic one, not a moral or ethical one. And, to be clear, I am not attacking Friedman for not writing about ethics, rather, I attack those who take his analysis as a starting point for questions of law as opposed to keeping it squarely where it belongs---in economics. On a related note, as there does not exist any Friedmanite legal philosophy, /there can be no corressponding Friedmanite position on anarchism vs statism/, as this would be a normative question, which is not addressed in his analysis. When pondering anarchism vs statism we must analyse the anarchist as opposed to the statist ethic, rather than thinking about what would happen in the event that either system were to be adhered to.

This is because even if we go through all the work of demonstrating, say, that an unhampered market will lead to a greater standard of living in the long run, we lack any corresponding reason as to why this makes it superior to the hampered market. Not only would this argument be entirely unconvincing to the high time preference man who doesn't give a damn about long-term benefits, or those welfare leeches who would indeed be worse off without a state even in the long-run, but even to the low time preference people who would have to prefer anarchism for some reason or another we have only demonstrated that they would prefer anarchism when we were setting out trying to demonstrate that we /should/ be anarchists as opposed to statists. Rather, in following this path of economics-first we have retreated into legal whim-worshipping---our argument is in the form of "you should be an anarchist because you would prefer anarchy to the state." But the fact that some set of people would prefer anarchy does not imply that they should be anarchists, as it may well be the case that John would prefer to rape Jane than to not rape her, but this does not imply that he /should/ rape her. It is, in fact, the case that he /should not/ rape her.

The moral argument stands far stonger in demonstrating the anarchist ethic to be correct, meaning that every single person /should/ be an anarchist whether they like it or not.

** Friedmanite Statism
Furthermore, to take the David Friedman position as the root of law is to remove any theoretic distinction between statism and anarchism; allow me to explain. To the legal-David-Friedmanite, who I shall call the polycentrist, law is determined through a process of negotiation between rights enforcement agencies and arbitration on undecided issues. So imagine there are two communities next to each other, one wants the right to play music super loudly and the other wants the right to have peace and quiet. The polycentrist has no objective basis of precedence that can determine whether the music players have a right to play music---instead they must leave it to arbitration to determine who has the property right. Essentially either the two communities are serviced by the same REA or they are serviced by different REAs, in the former case the polycentrist says that the law on the matter of music playing is solved by reference to the policies of the REA that runs everything. In the latter case, law can only be determined insofar as the two competing security agencies come to an agreement on what the law is. Of course, this leaves us with having no solution for what the law is when people disagree---this is a problem, becuase law is literally only ever relevant when people arent in agreement about how things should be done, when people are in perfect harmonious cooperation there are no conflicts.

Furthermore, if law is determined by the sayso of judges, nothing stops these judges from claiming that competition with them is disallowed---David Friedman does not provide us with any objective class theory to allow us to define state from non-state. The Austrians on the other hand, do have such a class theory, allowing Austrians, or more specifically anarcho-capitalists, to claim the title of anarchist---to be an anarchist you must first know what anarchism means...
