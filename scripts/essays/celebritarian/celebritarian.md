-   4:10 the open borders types are &ldquo;too married to ideology&rdquo;
-   22:10 &ldquo;the real world&rdquo;
-   he keeps coming in with this notion that open borders means &ldquo;owned by everyone&rdquo;&#x2014;it doesn&rsquo;t, it means owned by nobody.

### dave smith biblical anarchy podcast

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghqN_F2iTdU>
-   14:00 says that he would reject libertarian theory if it lead to things that make him feel icky
-   15:50 &ldquo;if there is government property it should be handled this way&rdquo;
    -   the question of what colour of uniform we should dress jews in as we gas them to death simply does not come up, the question of what brand of knife we should use to stab someone to death does not come up&#x2014;these things should not occur in the first place, you have already crossed Rothbard&rsquo;s razor
    -   its a question of property rights, does the government have property in those possessions? If not they have no right to exclude anybody from them and it is proper to oppose their forestalling of these goods
        -   its all well and good to say that you would prefer the streets to be sweeped and the grass to be mowed, but that is not the question that law answers
-   17:00 is the homeless drug addict a reductio case, or the expected outcome? Unclear.
    -   the reductios can go both ways&#x2014;on restricted immigration, prevent the children from ever leaving the school and prevent parents from retrieving them, turn it into a work camp.
-   The framing of &ldquo;while government property exists it should be restricted&rdquo; is dishonest&#x2014;we are the ones advocating that the government not restrict those possessions, that it be left open to homesteading
    -   the implicit premise is that open borders means that the government will let anyone in and that they will stop you from preventing people from coming in, but this is completely false.
        -   it&rsquo;s the idea that open borders means everyone owns public property&#x2014;this is a complete inversion of the actual stance, which is that it is not owned by anyone so it is liable for homesteading
-   28:40 &ldquo;there is this thing called government property, it is not a given that there should be no restrictions on it or that nobody owns it&rdquo;
    -   but who owns it?
-   33:10 can&rsquo;t deduce the property owner&#x2014;he calls this mental gymnastics, the proper position is that it is owned
    -   but BY WHO? WHO OWNS IT?
-   34:50 claims universal teleology is correct
-   38:00 says he will address my argument, but instead just makes the nonsense claim that theft means you have retroactively enslaved the person
-   44:00 says &ldquo;yeah, ok&rdquo; to the fact that there is no title transfer chain linking &ldquo;the taxpayers&rdquo; to the goods in question
    -   says its not the case that its unowned&#x2014;then who owns it?
-   46:30 just states my case that the homeless man has homesteaded a slide by sleeping on it, but what is the counterargument?
-   47:10 his question which apparently nobody would answer: two ways that we can privatise something, one way is that everyone on the block gets the piece of the street that extends beyond their house. The other proposal is that the road is given to a private company in swizerland.
    -   the proposal I am giving is that it be homesteaded, not &ldquo;given away&rdquo; because the government doesn&rsquo;t have the right to give it away
-   50:00 says that Ace is wrong that if you rob someone and buy something with the money that you only have a claim to the money, not what they buy
    -   but why? At what point do you start owning the thing they buy?
        -   misrepresents Ace as saying that the thing is therefore unowned&#x2014;no, it is owned by the guy who sold it
-   1:11:40 says its a win to put the entire military on the border&#x2014;what happens to the Mexicans who cross?
    -   let&rsquo;s be realistic! What plan would a state have when they are placing their entire military on the border? Could it perhaps be that they want to invade?
-   He doesn&rsquo;t address the domestic migration point&#x2014;why not ban migration between states within the union as well?
-   1:15:40 claims I will never have an impact on the culture&#x2014;we shall see.
-   1:16:40 says we are &ldquo;missing virtue&rdquo;
    -   at no point did I claim that legal theory is the entirety of ethics
-   1:30:10 says that we should approximate how it would be privately operated, but how? The ECP stands in the way
-   1:32:10 says that the net taxpayers don&rsquo;t own the property&#x2014;but then who does?

### did dave sell out his principles in advocating trump twitter space

-   he allowed random retards to speak for like hours on end, and then immediately removed people who were even remotely capable of pushing back at him
    -   he then lumps us in with those retards in a big package deal and uses it to justify not debating us.

### Dave Smith and his Wynand Downfall

-   &ldquo;I knew I would be disappointed&rdquo; - <https://x.com/jakeshieldsajj/status/1908456194152562844>
    -   Maybe don&rsquo;t have a political stategy that you know will disappoint you, and maybe don&rsquo;t degrade the people who were warning you that you would be disappointed.


<a id="org1d76a7d"></a>

### general

-   The people who didn&rsquo;t vote for &ldquo;John McCain&rdquo; were &ldquo;worse than communists&rdquo; <https://x.com/ComicDaveSmith/status/1908592279461253352>
-   &ldquo;He treats interviews like stand-up comedy, these are his workshopped bits. He can riff on them a little, but when you get to an interview where these don&rsquo;t work (ie. Andrew Wilson), he can&rsquo;t improvise based on principles and shits his pants. He resorts to being agreeable and handing out L word passes so the audience will still like him.&rdquo;
-   dave says that we are worse than communists
    -   dave smith is strategically worse than a communist or a nazi. Because those guys are not an active poison within the movement.
    -   we know the neo-prag stance on communists, since they buddied up with rectenwald, so it&rsquo;s perhaps not saying much
        -   &ldquo;you know who else is just as bad as communists? Communists! Perhaps left-communists like the Mises Caucus presidential pick, Mike Rectenwald.&rdquo;
-   Dave smith not a libertarian: send entire US military to secure the border, secure the border &ldquo;by any means necessary.&rdquo;
    -   this means:
        -   the entire 100-mile exclusion zone around the US will be under martial law
        -   the US government will be the ones to regulate what is &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; and so will have sole discression to turn off the constitution for literally anyone and will have the military to back it up
    -   Dave understands that these are the practical implications of his proposal, he has been talking about this shit for years&#x2014;this means he knows what he is asking for, knows that it is anti-liberty, and still wants it. He is not a libertarian.
    -   the people who are a problem, the west-haters as against the hard-working mexicans, are brought in by the US on planes. These would be exempt from his proposed solution. The cartels were caused by the US government in the first place&#x2014;deal with them by invading mexico.
    -   his explicit policy position is that the US be plunged into a martial law the likes of which are known only to North Korea. The practical implication of this is worse than every war of expansion the US has ever undertaken. It would be the death of capitalism.
        -   at least outright war hawks admit that they salivate over the bloodshed of innocents. Dave hides this policy behind layers upon layers of faux-libertarianism.
            -   this makes him more evil than them&#x2014;because of the sanctity of the movement which he has so tarnished.
    -   Dave doesn&rsquo;t just not understand libertarian theory&#x2014;he actively hates liberty.
        -   mistakes of this size are never made innocently&#x2014;he has heard all of our arguments numerous times and has deliberately chosen to pile us in with the gaggle of retards
        -   he understands that our arguments are of a different sort and deliberately buries them
        -   this is because he knows that his position is anti-liberty and wants to hide this from his audience
-   says RFK is not a libertarian: <https://youtu.be/Xr_xTRQLSLw?t=1354>, &ldquo;Dave Smith | A Response to James Lindsay | Part Of The Problem 1198&rdquo;
    -   &ldquo;this is the shit im talking about where people have this calcification of pattern recognition where everyone dissenting against you are among the same groups you got tired of years ago even where they&rsquo;re all different and even 95% on your side about amost everything else and you just throw your hands up and mock them bc they dont do anything bc theyre not in the party.&rdquo;
-   Dave Smith passes ideas through a social acceptability filter: <https://youtu.be/wKIPQXw_m4g?t=1213>
    -   &ldquo;Despite being so immensely popular, Dave posts Cole [coal] because he&rsquo;s ashamed of being a libertarian.&rdquo; - Harrison

## Cargo Cults

Among the indigenous tribes of the South Pacific there exists a peculiar phenomenon. The islanders began constructing facsimiles of airstrips using twigs and performing military drills with bamboo shoots in the place of guns.

Previously, these tribes had witnessed a great war between nations possessing technology they could not conceive of, and they saw that supplies would be brought to strange places they could not understand the true purpose of. Lacking any context for these great flying machines, they would attempt to entice them to bring gifts by building monuments in favour of whatever gods must have sent them.

These tribes are called cargo cults. Their operating premise is that if they simply build an area which looks like the airports they have seen, that they too will be able to receive the riches bestowed by the sky. That is, they have not understood the fundamental reason behind the activities they saw others engaged in; so they do not know that those activities were not the reason for success.

A similar mentality has gripped the libertarian movement; incapable or unwilling to understand the greats, most have resigned to simply imitating their movements, without understanding the purpose behind those movements. If this poison is not removed, we are doomed to fall into a world of communism. This is a poison that has gripped some of the most popular advocates of liberty. This is the anatomy of the celebritarian.

## The Philosophical Bust

These are not entirely disconnected events as these people would have you believe,<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> rather, the are both the direct result of the fundamental strategy that the neo-prags have taken up. All of it. The alienation of the radicals to court fiat libertarians to gain temporary culture war wins to eventually get&#x2014;what?

Not libertarianism. I have already proven that Dave is not for liberty, let&rsquo;s take a review of the others. Angela sold out that label to Trump to claim a &ldquo;Libertarian POTUS,&rdquo; her husband is running cover for his tariffs, and [something else]. It is all the same strategy, the same strategy that required Dave to label us as &ldquo;worse than communists.&rdquo; We *are* worse from his perspective, because we undermine him from within. We refute his entire plan. We negate the grift. Communists feed the grift.

*That* is that they are really after. The grift. The grift is their categorial imperative and the driving force of everything they do. This is why they herd over libertarians in name only; great for grifting, terrible for winning. They are a poison that should be immediately excised. They are the anarcho-stirnerites and anarcho-pragmatists that Murray Rothbard warned us about. And per Rothbard&rsquo;s advice they should, on their own premises, shut up and get out of the fucking way of people trying to do the real work to bring about anarchy.

There is a phenomenon in economic theory called the business cycle. It is a procession of expansion in the economy, followed by a contraction; which goes on in a loop, every boom being followed by a bust. The Austrian account of this is that investors look to the amount saved to decide how long-run their investments should be. Consider the case of Robinson Crusoe on the desert island; if he has saved only a few twigs and logs, he should perhaps invest in a small raft, but if he has a vastly greater amount of capital saved he can build an entire fishing trawler, or cruise line.

The same is true of the regular economy. Investors gauge how many resources have been saved by looking at the interest rates of loans. If the interest rates are super low, this means that a whole lot of resources have been put aside, so investors can wait longer to be repaid. If the interest rates are high, this means that not many resources have been put aside, and accordingly investors will require a sooner payment on the loan.

When a fractional reserve bank prints off more money than actually exists, it signals to investors that more resources have been saved than have actually been saved. This &ldquo;fiat&rdquo; money has mislead investors into making longer-run investments than they otherwise would have, so when they find this out, it is suddenly revealed that all of these investments were wrong, and the market goes bust.

We can draw out of this economic case a more general principle. The economic boom was essentially caused by a friendly-sounding deception&#x2014;a white lie if you will. Crusoe on our island is living in ignorance of the true state of his savings, because he has swallowed the falsehood that he is far better off than he really is. This falsehood will eventually run up against reality, and Crusoe will find that he has made incorrect decisions based upon his false premises. That&rsquo;s the general rule. When you operate upon false premises to generate some manner of &ldquo;fiat&rdquo; goodies&#x2013;that is, goodies which don&rsquo;t actually exist&#x2013;you will eventually reach some breaking point, where reality swoops in and demonstrates your choices to have been wrong. At such a point, a man has two options: he can either double-down and simply ignore this new fact of reality like he has been doing all along; or he can acknowledge the error of his ways and start to rebuild. The economic analogue for both would be either printing off more money to get another boom going, or letting the bubble burst, not bailing anyone out, and allowing capital to be reallocated to where it should have been in the first place.

Let us apply this generalised &ldquo;cycle of evasion&rdquo; to the case of the pragmatist strategy. Both the old prags and the neo-prags have as their guiding principle the herding over of fiat libertarians&#x2013;that is, libertarians in name only&#x2013;and the more they can herd into the tent the better they are said to be doing. This creates a libertarian &ldquo;boom&rdquo; period; where perhaps it becomes a very popular topic of discussion, and many people watch the podcasts, and many people attend the conferences. But, as discussed, this boom necessitates a bust. None of these people who were herded over were actually radicals for capitalism. None of them care about property rights as anything approaching a fundamental legal principle. They all inevitably wish to achieve some form of socialism in their various pet issues. It would be surprising if any one of them even understood the theory beyond the most basic soundbites.

After all, how could they ever advance beyond the stage of the soundbitatarian? These people are, by definition, followers; not leaders. By the fact that the pragmatist has taken as his guiding strategic light the herding in of sheep to generate fiat libertarians, he is selecting for people who do not carefully consider philosophy or come to their own conclusions on the various topics therein. Rather, he has selected for those who will just accept whatever hodgepodge of bundled philosophies which has been passed down to them; these bundles can come only in the form of soundbites.

By &ldquo;bundled philosophy&rdquo; I mean any philosophy which gives you a metaphysics (what is there?), epistemology (how do I know?), and ethics (what should I do about it?). For instance, a particularly primitive form of religious proselytising might go like: what is there? God is there. How do I know? God told me. What should I do about it? Whatever God says.

Here the anarcho-pragmatist has focused his activities on providing a specific soundbite to slot into someone&rsquo;s ethics, without worrying about integrating it with any other area in philosophy. In fact, integration is to be discouraged, can&rsquo;t we all just get along and sing kumbaya!? This suits the pragmatist, his target demographic is not capable of integration in the first place. This is a far larger demographic to grift on, and it is far easier to just feed these people soundbites than to do the real work of philosophy.

Specifically, the anarcho-pragmatist will merely present some soundbite like &ldquo;socially liberal, fiscally conservative,&rdquo; or; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t hurt people, and don&rsquo;t take their stuff,&rdquo; or; &ldquo;black guns matter,&rdquo; or; &ldquo;did you guys know that war is bad?,&rdquo; or; &ldquo;we need to run government like a business!,&rdquo; etc.

The pragmatist must ensure that the soundbites never get any more specific than this&#x2014;being vague is the entire point. If some radical comes along and explains that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t hurt people, and don&rsquo;t take their stuff&rdquo; is to be laughed out of any serious discussion on jurisprudence and that the proper principle it is trying to point at is called the non-aggression principle, which is precisely defined in terms of praxeology; this man is to be denounced and laughed at as &ldquo;too autistic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;too idealistic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;living in ancapistan in his head.&rdquo;

This is because, if the radical is allowed to speak to the fiat libertarians, they will quickly be turned off, and be made to understand that they have no place in this movement. The radical will demonstrate to the fiatatarian that there are many parts of the tent he was herded into that he finds repulsive; many conclusions that are not so wholesome chungus and feminist or super duper trad and MAGA, depending, of course, on which variety of pragmatist did the herding. The fiatatarian will be disgusted by these radical conclusions and will quickly run away to be herded elsewhere at which point he may post on social media that he used to be a libertarian, before he grew up that is!

So what exactly is the practical implication of successful pragmatism&#x2014;that is, pragmatism which generates many fiat libertarians. What is the consequence of the strategy which is revealed in the bust phase?

In the first case, the strategy involves a direct alienation of radicals. As discussed above, it is either-or. In the pursuit of milquetoast, pragmatist messaging, you have to simultaneously denounce radical messaging. One is forced to explain that they are not like those crazy anarchists, they just want reasonable limits on government overreach! The pragmatist must lionize the &ldquo;sensible&rdquo; or &ldquo;centrist&rdquo; path, and reject the &ldquo;idealistic&rdquo; or &ldquo;utopian&rdquo; one.

It is not possible to have it both ways. Those who attempt to &ldquo;be everyone&rsquo;s friend&rdquo; inevitably run up against this fact. In any opportunity where this type is given the choice between backing a radical or throwing him under the bus for a culture war win, they take the latter 10 times out of 10. If one of these kumbaya-atarians were to take the radical side, they become radicals and immediately place themselves in opposition to the pragmatists. In reality, kumbaya-atarianism is just another form of pragmatism; it is the denunciation of reality and principle, in favour of fiat and compromise. After all, can&rsquo;t we all just get along!? We cannot. There is no middle ground between A and non-A, the excluded middle does not exist. The kumbaya-atarian exists at most as a higher-order pragmatist; where the first order pragmatist attempts to bridge between radicals and normies by herding the latter into the libertarian tent, the second order pragmatist attempts to bridge between pragmatists and radicals by herding the pragmatists into the radical tent. An attempt which fails for obvious reasons.

Not only does the pragmatist strategy necessitate the direct alienation of radicals, it also indirectly alienates them by making coordination between radicals more difficult. If I find myself in this tent which is being constantly fluffed up by an influx of people who hate libertarianism, but have had the label hastily stamped on their forehead upon entry, it becomes increasingly more challenging to find other radicals in the movement to converse and organise with.

One might find himself in a supposedly-libertarian party or conference and be faced with legion subversions to the theory. &ldquo;Oh, I am definitely a libertarian, but it violates my NAP to allow any immigration;&rdquo; &ldquo;oh, you misunderstand, it is actually an initiation of force to lie about someone as it damages their reputation: free speech in moderation, I say!;&rdquo; &ldquo;oh, the non-aggression principle is definitely true, but aggression means when the Proletariat are exploited, so we need socialism to be truly free.&rdquo;

These subversions have two sources: (1) through fiatatarian bringing along their old bad premises, but translating them into libertarian terminology; and (2) through active subverters in the movement. These subverters come into the tent through the gaping hole made by the pragmatists, seek out new and easily swayed advocates of liberty, and fill their head with poison. These subverters are in the business of trying to herd people out of the liberty tent, and into their own ideologies tent. Even if they fail to lead the individual completely back home, they often succeed in demonstrating to him that the libertarian movement is full of bad actors, and is not to be engaged with. This counts as victory also.

All of this indirect alienation ends up in the same place: the radical vanguard is slowed down, and slowly loses members to attrition. Potential members of the vanguard are unable to find it, and are left wandering forever. And without this base of radicals the movement becomes doomed to failure, perhaps needing to be spun off into a new ideology, leaving the old one to rot.

The movement *must* die without the radicals because without the radicals there is not, strictly speaking, any movement at all. That is, the radical base are not merely the core, or guiding light, or misguided autistic wing of the movement; the radicals *are* the movement. Every single other person in the tent is either entirely irrelevant or an active hindrance to the movement. Properly speaking, one cannot describe this ballast as part of any movement as they generate no *motion*. They exist only as inertia, they go along in the same direction unless acted upon by some force generated by radicals. Having this inertia is a very bad thing for a small ideology, because the active subverters can provide this force just as fully as the radical vanguard.
