** the argument
Second-Handedness is where a man lives second-hand: he lives through others, substitutes others' judgements, values, ideas, attitudes, for their own. This is not forming independent agreement with others on something, it is conformity, non-thinking, selflessness. This is surrender of ones mind---the ultimate betrayal of the self. Altruism demands that you stop thinking for yourself because that's selfish!
