## Oakland, California

In Oakland, California, Yemini immigrant Sam Mardaie is attending to his gas station in the wee hours of the morning when a crowd of some 80 to 100 attendees from a nearby automobile sideshow approached his store.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Mardaie alleges that the mob were unsatisfied that the location only offered window service at this time of the night, and so they began ransacking his business in a so-called &ldquo;flash robbery&rdquo;<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> over the course of about 40 minutes.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> It is reported that &ldquo;dozens were seen milling around the store looking for things to steal. They pulled drinks from the fridges and others were putting their stolen goods in boxes or baskets that appeared to belong to the store itself.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>

In total, the collective would cause $100k of damages, including taking around $25k from the store&rsquo;s register and ATM.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup> Two employees were threatened during the pillaging, this all prompting Mardaie to contact the police, but unfortunately his pleas would go unanswered. The department classed the incident as a &ldquo;Priority 2&rdquo; and would not send any officers until nine hours after the robbery began, referring Mardaie to their online reporting service.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>

You see, the police were too busy dealing with a &ldquo;street takeover&rdquo; near the airport<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>&#x2014;an event which consists of an unruly and drugged mob shutting down major intersections to display their reckless abandon for life and property.

On the next street over,<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup> there used to sit an In-N-Out restaurant; the only location in Oakland. This store would close down a few months prior after 18 years of operation due to the insane rate of crime:<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>

> We have made the decision to close our In-N-Out Burger location in Oakland, California, due to ongoing issues with crime. Despite taking repeated steps to create safer conditions, our Customers and Associates are regularly victimized by car break-ins, property damage, theft, and armed robberies. Our last day of business in Oakland will be Sunday, March 24, 2024.
> 
> We are grateful for the local community, which has supported us for over 18 years, and we recognize that this closure negatively impacts our Associates and their families.
> 
> Additionally, this location remains a busy and profitable one for the company, but our top priority must be the safety and wellbeing of our Customers and Associates - we cannot ask them to visit or work in an unsafe environment.
> 
> All affected Associates will have the opportunity to transfer to a nearby In-N-Out location or, alternatively, receive a severance package. In-N-Out Burger has a history of supporting the Oakland community through charitable giving that predates the opening of our location there. Although we will no longer do business there, we will continue to support local charitable organizations in Oakland through our In-N-Out Burger Foundation and Slave 2 Nothing Foundation.
