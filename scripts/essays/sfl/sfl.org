** facts
+ Florian F. Windberger (https://studentsforliberty.org/blog/staff/florian-f-windberger/) ousted Sude because she defended Ross Ulbricht, attacked Islam, and claimed that homeless people are homeless by choice. Sude called him a liar because he made an arbitrary claim that Ross engaged in child sex trafficking---which is false and she proved it to be false.
+ Wolf (the CEO) reportedly has a calendar item called "Dealing with perceived enemies of the organization"
+ SFL received funding from John McCain institute
+ sude was invited to top 25 leaders premium retreat 2 months before being ousted for not being involved enough---clear contradiction.
** speculation
+ Wolf is embezzling money through his wife's company
