#+TITLE: Queen's Jubilee

* Main Body
The Queen's Platinum Jubilee is to be understood as an attempt by the state to sway public opinion in its favour. To understand this we acknowledge economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe's sociology of statism, which describes that the state as a relatively small class of expropriators that requires favourable public opinion to stay in power. If it did not have favourable public opinion, the relatively far larger expropriated class would not stand for the expropriation, and there would be nothing that could be done to force them to concede.
