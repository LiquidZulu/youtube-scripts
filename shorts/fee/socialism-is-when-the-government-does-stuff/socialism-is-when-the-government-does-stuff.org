#+title: Socialism Is When The Government Does Stuff

[Socialism is when the government does stuff.] Some people claim that this is incorrect---that they are not socialists, they only want the government to meddle in certain isolated aspects of the economy. This is a false start, Mises shows us in /Planned Chaos/ that this is not a compromise between socialism and capitalism, it is rather inconsistently applied socialism.

At the end of the day, someone has to decide what is produced and how to produce it---if it is not entrepreneurs making these decisions based upon the private decisions of men, then it must be that their plans are being substituted for the plans of some socialist central planner. There is no sensical middle road between these extremes, you are either in favour of the market, or total government omnipotence in controlling the private lives of men and how they use their own property. And that is why socialism is when the government does stuff.
