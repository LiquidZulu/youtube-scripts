#+title: Equality of Opportunity is the Opposite of Equality of Outcome

[Equality of opportunity is what made America great, and its opposite--equality of outcome--is set up to destroy that greatness.] What the founders meant when they said that "all men are created equal" is that they come into this world with the same legal and ethical status---it is up to them to make what they will of their lives. This equal-opportunities stance is mutually exclusive with the sense of equality popular today, where it is said that to be truly equal, all men must have identical outcomes with their lives.

This is because, for there to be equal outcomes, all men must be enslaved to the will of a central planner, who decides which outcomes are appropriate, and which are outside of your station. Mises pointed out that such a society is doomed to failure due to the economic calculation problem.

It is fine for people to spend their lives in less productive work, but that they made this choice does not make it wrong for others to make a different choice. Without the freedom to choose your own path in life it is impossible for society to get richer which is why equality of opportunity is what made America great, and its opposite--equality of outcome--is set up to destroy that greatness.
