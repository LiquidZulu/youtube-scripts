#+title: Americanism

[America is fundamentally individualist.] The real revolution that the founders fought for was not one to establish a new nation with a new king, but to establish a society under a completely new ideology---Americanism.

This new idea was truly groundbreaking, holding that each and every man has inalienable, individual rights by his very nature. This is in stark contrast to every other society at the time, which held that every man was merely a cell in the collective body---that society may use and dispose of him for whatever purposes it deems fit, that man lives only by the permission of and for the sake of the collective.

To the founders, each man holds his rights /against/ the collective, they recognised that this is necessary for a just and prosperous society, hence why America is fundamentally individualist.
