#+title: The Lockean US

[There is no such thing as a right to food, healthcare, or education.] It is not uncommon that the US is criticised online for refusing to ratify some such entitlement decreed by the UN to be a right---but this refusal is entirely inline with the true meaning of rights that the United States was founded upon.

The founders rested their new nation upon the philosophy of John Locke, who held that rights were ethical barriers that held back the collective, rather than coupons entitling you to services from it. After all, "society" has no real existence, all that exists is the people who make it up---a right to healthcare would involve a right held against doctors that they treat you against their consent. This rests upon the premise that doctors, and everyone else, are mere organs of the great societal body.

The enemies of liberty stole the term "rights" along with the prestige it obtained to apply to their numerous government restrictions, and that is why there is no such thing as a right to food, healthcare or education.
