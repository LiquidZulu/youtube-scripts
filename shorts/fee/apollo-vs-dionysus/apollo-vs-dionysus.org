#+title: Apollo vs Dionysus

[The real culture war is a clash between Apollo and Dionysus.] Apollo is the Greek god of truth and light; Dionysus of wine and madness. The Apollonian spirit in man is found in his power to think and produce where a Dionysian would cower away from reality, and retreat into a world of his own.

The embodiments of Apollo are great industrialists such as Elon Musk and Steve Jobs who invent revolutionary new technologies to push man into ever-receding frontiers---the Dionysian spirit is found in those who want an eternal lockdown such that they may live in their pod shut off in a VR world, sustaining themselves through stimulus cheques extracted from Apollo.

These parasites rely on the constant production of the Apollonians whilst denouncing this production as evil---if Apollo were ever to agree and stop producing, humanity would quickly crumble. Do not be a parasite, be a producer, a man of the mind, and recognise who it is that you are fighting, because the real culture war is a clash between Apollo and Dionysus.
