#+TITLE: How Everyone Profits Under Capitalism

* intro
In today's #short I will be going over the austrian observation that there is necessary ex ante mutual profit in voluntary trade.

* explanation
The term 'ex ante' means 'before the event', so to break the observation down; we have a necessary mutual profit in every voluntary trade in the ex ante sense, meaning that while any party may regret their decision to trade, when they made the trade they valued making that trade more than not making the trade --- or else they would not have agreed.

* example
Say that John is buying a hotdog from a hotdog vendor for $5. From this we know that, for some reason, John values the hotdog more than the $5, and conversely that the hotdog vendor values the $5 more than the hotdog. In this example they both end up with the more valuable item, they both profit.
