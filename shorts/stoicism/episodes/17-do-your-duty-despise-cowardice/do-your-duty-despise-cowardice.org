* Main Body
Stand up straight in life, dont be propped up by others, and do your duty without fear --- focus more on whether what you're doing is right or wrong, than on the risk it brings you.

#+begin_quote
You are much mistaken, my friend, if you think that any man worth his salt cares about the risk of death and doesn’t concentrate on this alone: whether what he’s doing is right or wrong, and his behavior a good man’s or a bad one’s.
