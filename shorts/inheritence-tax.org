#+TITLE: Why Inheretence Tax is the WORST Tax

* the scenario
Imagine two brothers; A and B who both have high paying jobs and make a lot of money.

* A
Brother A spends his money on chasing women and partying all the time.

* B
Brother B on the other hand saves up and is very frugal with his income because he wants to leave money to his children in his will.

* estate tax applied
Would anyone say that we ought to tax brother B more than brother A? If the purpose of taxation is to tax behaviours you wish to discourage an inheritence tax seeks to discourage saving money --- something few want.
