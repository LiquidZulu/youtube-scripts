#+TITLE: Depp Vs Heard

* Main Body
It is unjust to force Amber Heard to pay Johnny Depp damages as a result of defamation against him. This is because it is not a crime under natural law to lie about a man, even if that lie makes other people not like the man. Imagine I told you that Walter Block likes to take a bath with a rubber ducky and you hate people who do such things so you decide that you don't want to be friends with Walter---who's rights have actually been violated here? Can't be Walter's, as none of his property was involved in this interaction, so I could not have initiated any conflicts with him. So we see that there does not exist a just punishment for such a lie as no crime has been committed.
