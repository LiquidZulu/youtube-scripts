#+title: The History of Philosophy: Who Needs It?

* outline
+ philosophy as a guide, the importance of philosophy
  + everyone has a philosophy
  + philosophy drives the course of history---philosophical theory of history
+ the philosophical business cycle
+ a note on interpretation and evaluation
  + this course is going to be implicitly evaluative
  + cartesian doubt with respect to the interpretation: it is not on me to ensure that I have covered an indeterminate number of interpretations and "you didn't read it in the original language" is not a rejoinder.
