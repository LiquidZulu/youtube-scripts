0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:18,000
6. Defensive force and proportionality

3
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:19,960
No doubt punishment serves many purposes.

4
0:00:19,960 --> 0:00:23,240
It can deter crime and prevent the offender from committing further crimes.

5
0:00:23,240 --> 0:00:25,800
Punishment can even rehabilitate some criminals, if it is not capital.

6
0:00:25,800 --> 0:00:30,280
It can serve to satisfy a victim's longing for revenge or his relatives' desire to avenge.

7
0:00:30,280 --> 0:00:33,040
Punishment can also be used as a lever to gain restitution, recompense for some of the

8
0:00:33,040 --> 0:00:34,480
damage caused by the crime.

9
0:00:34,480 --> 0:00:37,640
For these reasons, the issue of punishment is and always has been of vital concern to

10
0:00:37,640 --> 0:00:38,640
civilized people.

11
0:00:38,640 --> 0:00:41,920
They want to know the effects of punishment and the effective ways of carrying it out.

12
0:00:41,920 --> 0:00:42,920
Stephan Kinsella

13
0:00:42,920 --> 0:00:47,040
Thusfar, this course has elucidated theories and examples denoting what is and what is not aggression.

14
0:00:47,040 --> 0:00:48,040
Now that we know what it means to be criminal,

15
0:00:48,040 --> 0:00:51,080
this lesson will answer the question of what actions are just in defending against and punishing aggressions.

16
0:00:51,080 --> 0:00:54,120
A

17
0:00:54,120 --> 0:00:56,080
First, what does it mean to punish?

18
0:00:56,080 --> 0:00:58,840
Dictionary definitions are easy to come by, but in the sense that interests those of us

19
0:00:58,840 --> 0:01:02,920
who want to punish, punishment is the infliction of physical force upon a person, in response

20
0:01:02,920 --> 0:01:05,080
to something that he has done or failed to do.

21
0:01:05,080 --> 0:01:08,520
Punishment thus comprises physical violence committed against a person's body, or against

22
0:01:08,520 --> 0:01:12,920
any other property that a person legitimately owns, against any rights that a person has.

23
0:01:12,920 --> 0:01:16,520
Punishment is for, or in response to some action, inaction or feature or status of the

24
0:01:16,520 --> 0:01:20,320
person punished, otherwise it is simply random violence, which is not usually considered

25
0:01:20,320 --> 0:01:21,320
to be punishment.

26
0:01:21,320 --> 0:01:24,880
Thus when we punish a person is because we consider him to be a wrongdoer of some sort,

27
0:01:24,880 --> 0:01:28,840
we typically want to teach him or others a lesson, or enact vengeance or restitution

28
0:01:28,840 --> 0:01:29,840
for what he has done.

29
0:01:29,840 --> 0:01:34,000
Note that the question of justifying a punishment only arises

30
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:35,560
insofar as the wrongdoer rejects the justice of the punishment.

31
0:01:35,560 --> 0:01:38,840
That is to say, if the criminal consents to a certain retaliation, this retaliation is per se just,

32
0:01:38,840 --> 0:01:42,720
as there can be no conflicts where the wills of men are in harmony.

33
0:01:42,720 --> 0:01:46,720
Justifying a punishment is far more challenging when the criminal does not consent,

34
0:01:46,720 --> 0:01:49,800
i.e., when the criminal wishes to challenge the justice of a given punishment.

35
0:01:49,800 --> 0:01:53,240
We know from prior analysis that this challenge seeks to test the justification against the

36
0:01:53,240 --> 0:01:55,960
nature of argumentally justifying as such.

37
0:01:55,960 --> 0:02:00,120
If the punishment cannot be justified without thereby falling into contradiction, it is unjust.

38
0:02:00,120 --> 0:02:03,960
Therefore, the nature of argumentation is a suitable starting point to obtain a rational

39
0:02:03,960 --> 0:02:08,280
theory of punishment, recall that contradictions are falsehoods,

40
0:02:08,280 --> 0:02:09,480
and thus not a feature of a correct argument.

41
0:02:09,480 --> 0:02:13,800
Therefore, a person can be prevented from making certain claims in a dialectic

42
0:02:13,800 --> 0:02:15,440
if those claims are inconsistent with his actions.

43
0:02:15,440 --> 0:02:19,320
To be abundantly clear, to avoid any confusion, the person is not being prevented from making

44
0:02:19,320 --> 0:02:23,720
these claims by a judge or a cop or whatever, physically coercing him into not making claims.

45
0:02:23,720 --> 0:02:27,320
He's prevented from making these claims by the very nature of dialectic as such.

46
0:02:27,320 --> 0:02:31,320
In other words, if he did make those knowingly incorrect claims,

47
0:02:31,320 --> 0:02:35,320
he would not be engaged in argumentation, he would rather be babbling or telling a joke or something else.

48
0:02:35,320 --> 0:02:38,880
This forms the root of what Kinsella dubs "Dialogical Estoppel."

49
0:02:38,880 --> 0:02:43,080
Lord Coke explains that the word estoppel is used because a man's own act or acceptance

50
0:02:43,080 --> 0:02:48,240
stoppeth or closeth up his mouth, and dialogical refers to dialogue, aka argumentation,

51
0:02:48,240 --> 0:02:52,040
so we can say that a man is, by the nature of argumentation as such,

52
0:02:52,040 --> 0:02:54,680
estopped from making certain inconsistent or contradictory claims.

53
0:02:54,680 --> 0:02:57,440
QUOTE To say that a person is estopped from making certain claims means that these claims cannot

54
0:02:57,440 --> 0:03:01,440
even possibly be right, because they are contradictory, is to recognise that his assertion is simply

55
0:03:01,440 --> 0:03:03,080
wrong because it is contradictory.

56
0:03:03,080 --> 0:03:06,960
Applying estoppel in such a manner perfectly complements the very purpose of dialogue.

57
0:03:06,960 --> 0:03:09,880
Dialogue is by its nature an activity aimed at finding truth.

58
0:03:09,880 --> 0:03:13,000
Anyone engaging in argument is necessarily endeavouring to discern the truth about some

59
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,840
particular subject, to the extent that this is not the case, there is no dialogue occurring,

60
0:03:16,840 --> 0:03:20,600
but mere babbling or even physical fighting, nor can this be denied.

61
0:03:20,600 --> 0:03:23,920
Anyone engaging in an argument long enough to deny that truth is the goal of the discourse

62
0:03:23,920 --> 0:03:27,840
contradicts himself, because he is himself asserting or challenging the truth of a given

63
0:03:27,840 --> 0:03:28,840
proposition.

64
0:03:28,840 --> 0:03:32,320
Thus the assertion as true of anything that simply cannot be true is incompatible with

65
0:03:32,320 --> 0:03:36,200
the very purpose of discourse, anything that cannot be true is contrary to the truth finding

66
0:03:36,200 --> 0:03:39,800
END QUOTE purpose of discourse, and thus is not permissible within the bounds of a discourse.

67
0:03:39,800 --> 0:03:43,200
Let us apply this theory of estoppel to the case of A punching B.

68
0:03:43,200 --> 0:03:46,320
Assume that this is the extent of the assault, as the question of defending against

69
0:03:46,320 --> 0:03:48,240
an ongoing aggression shall be discussed in the next section.

70
0:03:48,240 --> 0:03:52,440
B decides that he wants to punish A in an eye-for-an-eye manner by punching him back,

71
0:03:52,440 --> 0:03:56,440
or perhaps by hiring a champion C to punch A if B cannot or does not want to do this himself.

72
0:03:56,440 --> 0:03:57,440
If A were to challenge this punishment he would claim that this punching of him

73
0:03:57,440 --> 0:04:00,440
is an impermissible action, i.e. that people should be prohibited from punching him,

74
0:04:00,440 --> 0:04:04,640
but A has previously demonstrated that he thinks he should not be prohibited from punching B.

75
0:04:04,640 --> 0:04:08,240
A has presupposed that punching people sans-consent is just,

76
0:04:08,240 --> 0:04:12,720
and is now explicitly making claim that it is unjust.

77
0:04:12,720 --> 0:04:14,640
This is a clearly incoherent position.

78
0:04:14,640 --> 0:04:18,360
Thus A is estopped from challenging his punishment, therefore we revert back to the simple case

79
0:04:18,360 --> 0:04:21,240
of an unchallenged punishment, which is per se just.

80
0:04:21,240 --> 0:04:23,400
Note that this applies only to punching as the punishment.

81
0:04:23,400 --> 0:04:27,200
A could coherently argue that it is unjust to murder him, or to take a lock of his hair,

82
0:04:27,200 --> 0:04:30,800
or to tear up his prized roses, as these retaliations would be of an entirely different sort.

83
0:04:30,800 --> 0:04:31,800
A

84
0:04:31,800 --> 0:04:35,760
That is, by merely punching B, A presupposes only that punching is proper conduct,

85
0:04:35,760 --> 0:04:39,960
but he does not per se presuppose that any other invasions of property borders are proper.

86
0:04:39,960 --> 0:04:42,240
This is where the concept of proportionality comes in.

87
0:04:42,240 --> 0:04:45,840
The retribution against an aggressor must come in the same form as the aggression,

88
0:04:45,840 --> 0:04:48,920
or else the punishment is further aggression, and thus not just.

89
0:04:48,920 --> 0:04:53,200
In short, just retribution is an eye for an eye, not an eye for a tooth.

90
0:04:53,200 --> 0:04:56,440
There are a number of potential objections to this theory that A might forward.

91
0:04:56,440 --> 0:04:59,240
First he might claim that his positions are not that punching is proper, and that punching is improper,

92
0:04:59,240 --> 0:05:03,560
but rather that A punching B is proper, and anyone punching A is improper.

93
0:05:03,560 --> 0:05:07,080
Thus there is no contradiction, and he is not estopped from challenging his punishment.

94
0:05:07,080 --> 0:05:11,040
The issue here is that any norm must in principle be universalisable,

95
0:05:11,040 --> 0:05:13,200
if it is to be proposed in an argument, as Hoppe points out.

96
0:05:13,200 --> 0:05:16,800
Quite commonly, it has been observed that argumentation implies that a proposition claims universal

97
0:05:16,800 --> 0:05:20,800
acceptability, or should it be a norm proposal that is universalizable.

98
0:05:20,800 --> 0:05:23,960
Applied to norm proposals, this is the idea, as formulated by the Golden Rule of Ethics

99
0:05:23,960 --> 0:05:28,240
or the Kantian Categorical Imperative, that only those norms can be justified, that

100
0:05:28,240 --> 0:05:31,840
END QUOTE can be formulated as general principles, which are valid for everyone without exception.

101
0:05:31,840 --> 0:05:36,360
This is because, if one is to claim any proposition as being argumentatively valid,

102
0:05:36,360 --> 0:05:37,720
said proposition must be rational.

103
0:05:37,720 --> 0:05:41,520
What this means is that it must in principle be valid, no matter who it is proposed to.

104
0:05:41,520 --> 0:05:45,080
To reject this would be to adopt a polylogism, i.e. that a proposition might be true when

105
0:05:45,080 --> 0:05:48,960
levied in one argument, but not when levied in another, and it was shown in the first lesson

106
0:05:48,960 --> 0:05:52,360
that polylogism implies contradiction, making it false.

107
0:05:52,360 --> 0:05:56,560
So universalisability is therefore a pre-supposition of the very normative discourse that A would

108
0:05:56,560 --> 0:05:59,760
be partaking in by attempting to reject his punishment, but the norm that it is fine for

109
0:05:59,760 --> 0:06:03,560
A to punch B, but not for others to punch A, is not universalisable.

110
0:06:03,560 --> 0:06:06,680
We would be faced with a contradiction if we tried to swap out A for B and hold both

111
0:06:06,680 --> 0:06:10,840
norms simultaneously, meaning this norm cannot be applied to everyone.

112
0:06:10,840 --> 0:06:15,120
QUOTE escape the application of the estoppel by arbitrarily specialising his otherwise inconsistent

113
0:06:15,120 --> 0:06:18,200
END QUOTE views with liberally sprinkled "for me only's."

114
0:06:18,200 --> 0:06:21,880
Kinsella points out further that even if we were to throw away the requirement of universalisability,

115
0:06:21,880 --> 0:06:25,040
and instead assume that norms can be particularised in this way, this would mean that B could

116
0:06:25,040 --> 0:06:29,120
simply particularise his punishment norm, and thus claim it to be just for him to retaliate.

117
0:06:29,120 --> 0:06:33,400
We would quickly regress into incoherent subjectivist ramblings of might making right,

118
0:06:33,400 --> 0:06:36,920
so this objection by particularisation fails, leaving our aggressor estopped once more.

119
0:06:36,920 --> 0:06:41,000
A second potential counter A might raise, however, is that he has changed his mind,

120
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,200
i.e. he used to think it proper to punch people, but he has had a change of heart

121
0:06:44,200 --> 0:06:48,160
and now realises that such conduct is evil, and therefore he is not currently in contradiction,

122
0:06:48,160 --> 0:06:50,280
and thus not estopped from objecting to his punishment.

123
0:06:50,280 --> 0:06:52,520
There are a number of problems with A's approach here.

124
0:06:52,520 --> 0:06:56,640
First, if changing one's mind means that one is no longer liable for prior actions,

125
0:06:56,640 --> 0:07:00,400
then all B must do is punch A, then afterwards claim that he has changed his mind about that

126
0:07:00,400 --> 0:07:03,840
punishment, meaning he is also not responsible. You'll notice that this would quickly devolve

127
0:07:03,840 --> 0:07:07,320
into might-plus-regret and makes right, which would be an irrational ethic.

128
0:07:07,320 --> 0:07:11,840
Second, by A changing his mind, he is per se denouncing his prior actions, thus asserting

129
0:07:11,840 --> 0:07:15,520
that aggressions are indeed impermissible. This would mean that he could not coherently deny

130
0:07:15,520 --> 0:07:18,920
the right of the victim of aggression to punish their aggression. To say that an action is

131
0:07:18,920 --> 0:07:21,520
permissible is to say that one may not legally punish it.

132
0:07:21,520 --> 0:07:24,920
Third, this mind-changing is still a form of particularisation, it is to claim that the

133
0:07:24,920 --> 0:07:28,400
logical structure of what it means to presuppose an action as a legitimate can change by the

134
0:07:28,400 --> 0:07:31,880
mere fact that the person presupposing said legitimacy also thinks that the action

135
0:07:31,880 --> 0:07:35,240
is illegitimate. Let's unpack this. What A is asserting here is that they believe in

136
0:07:35,240 --> 0:07:38,320
their heart that punching is illegitimate, whether they only start holding this fact

137
0:07:38,320 --> 0:07:41,600
after doing the punching isn't particularly relevant. All that matters is that at the

138
0:07:41,600 --> 0:07:45,160
moment of the assault, A must presuppose that punching is a legitimate action. This could

139
0:07:45,160 --> 0:07:48,880
take place simultaneously with A believing it to be illegitimate or not, men are capable

140
0:07:48,880 --> 0:07:52,520
of believing in contradictory things after all. What is important is that A cannot drop

141
0:07:52,520 --> 0:07:56,560
the presupposition that punching is illegitimate. He has already committed the act of aggression

142
0:07:56,560 --> 0:08:00,840
that presupposes this as a legitimate interaction. Because he cannot drop the presupposition,

143
0:08:00,840 --> 0:08:03,640
in order to resolve the contradiction, he is left with only the option of dropping his

144
0:08:03,640 --> 0:08:06,760
challenge to aggression. Therefore, he is estopped by definition.

145
0:08:06,760 --> 0:08:10,240
I will reiterate this point for clarity. What makes a man estopped from challenging a given

146
0:08:10,240 --> 0:08:13,600
punishment is that the given challenge would imply a contradiction, meaning that it cannot

147
0:08:13,600 --> 0:08:17,800
be uttered in an argument. When I perform some action X, I thereby presuppose by this performance

148
0:08:17,800 --> 0:08:21,840
that I think I should do X as opposed to not X. There is some confusion over this thesis.

149
0:08:21,840 --> 0:08:24,920
Often, I have encountered the counter-argument of the man who is smoking and says that he should stop.

150
0:08:24,920 --> 0:08:28,360
Does this man not believe that he should stop? Is he lying when he says he should stop?

151
0:08:28,360 --> 0:08:31,960
That is not necessarily the case. We can indeed imagine a man who is currently

152
0:08:31,960 --> 0:08:35,880
engaged in the act of smoking. A man who is chosen to smoke rather than not smoke, who

153
0:08:35,880 --> 0:08:39,880
nonetheless believes that he should not smoke. This does not establish that he is not also

154
0:08:39,880 --> 0:08:43,800
presupposing that he should smoke. It is possible for a person to hold two contradictory beliefs

155
0:08:43,800 --> 0:08:48,200
at the same time. We call this cognitive dissonance. Consider the anarchist who goes through

156
0:08:48,200 --> 0:08:52,000
the labor of demonstrating that taxation is theft and that theft is bad. Therefore,

157
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:56,080
taxation is bad, only to be confronted by a statist opponent who agrees that taxation

158
0:08:56,080 --> 0:08:59,800
is theft and that is bad, but still asserts that taxation is a good thing that should continue.

159
0:08:59,800 --> 0:09:03,360
It is clear to anyone who has encountered stupid people that a man is fully capable

160
0:09:03,360 --> 0:09:07,000
of holding contradictory theses at the same time. The upshot of this for our smoker is

161
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:10,080
that by choosing to smoke rather than not smoke, it must be the case that he believes

162
0:09:10,080 --> 0:09:14,320
that he should smoke rather than not smoke. But this does not preclude the possibility

163
0:09:14,320 --> 0:09:17,960
that our smoker also believes that he should not smoke. It is just that his belief that

164
0:09:17,960 --> 0:09:21,960
he should smoke is in some way overpowering his contradictory belief. There is a further

165
0:09:21,960 --> 0:09:24,840
confusion to be addressed at this point, which stems from a conflation between two

166
0:09:24,840 --> 0:09:28,120
different senses of the word "ought." To highlight this, consider the statement, it is raining

167
0:09:28,120 --> 0:09:31,120
outside. Therefore, you ought bring an umbrella. Now, there are two ways which one

168
0:09:31,120 --> 0:09:34,920
could interpret this statement. Either (1) ought is being used in its precise logical

169
0:09:34,920 --> 0:09:39,280
meaning, or (2) it is being used as prudential advice. For (1) it simply does not follow

170
0:09:39,280 --> 0:09:42,760
that because it is raining, you ought bring an umbrella, at least not without additional steps.

171
0:09:42,760 --> 0:09:47,040
For (2) ought is being used colloquially. If we were to precisely formulate (2) it

172
0:09:47,040 --> 0:09:50,640
would be something like, it is raining outside, so if you do not wish to get wet when you go

173
0:09:50,640 --> 0:09:54,120
outside, a potential means to achieve this goal would be to bring an umbrella. When formulated

174
0:09:54,120 --> 0:09:57,440
precisely, it becomes clear that when prudential advice is given like this, the statement is

175
0:09:57,440 --> 0:10:01,120
really an is statement, rather than an ought statement. This insight will become crucial

176
0:10:01,120 --> 0:10:04,760
in the next lesson, so I will not stress it too heavily here. But the key takeaway for

177
0:10:04,760 --> 0:10:08,560
now is that there is only ought. Ought is ought. There doesn't exist different "flavours"

178
0:10:08,560 --> 0:10:13,200
of ought in logic. It is a failure of imprecision to mix and colloquial usages of this word.

179
0:10:13,200 --> 0:10:16,240
Bringing this back to our criminal A, who wishes to challenge his punishment for punching

180
0:10:16,240 --> 0:10:20,600
B, he has already demonstrated by his conduct that he thinks punching is a legitimate interaction

181
0:10:20,600 --> 0:10:24,440
if he then states that it is not a legitimate interaction, which is required for him to

182
0:10:24,440 --> 0:10:28,360
challenge this punishment, he is in contradiction. To resolve a contradiction between these two

183
0:10:28,360 --> 0:10:32,720
statements, one of the statements has to be dropped. Because they simply cannot drop

184
0:10:32,720 --> 0:10:36,000
the statement that punching is proper, he is left only with being able to drop the statement

185
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,840
that punching is improper. The statement that punching is improper is the one that is required

186
0:10:39,840 --> 0:10:43,800
for him to challenge the punishment. Therefore, A cannot challenge his punishment. He is dialogically estopped from doing so.

187
0:10:43,800 --> 0:10:48,000
An important note must be made with respect to the application of this theory of dialogical estoppel.

188
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,760
A keen eye will notice that men are only estopped insofar as they chose to commit the aggression.

189
0:10:51,760 --> 0:10:56,320
That is, a man is only estopped when he purposefully engaged in the trespass in question.

190
0:10:56,320 --> 0:11:00,600
If a man did not purposefully aggress but rather accidentally aggressed,

191
0:11:00,600 --> 0:11:05,080
we say that he lacks mens rea. Mens rea is a legal term meaning guilty mind.

192
0:11:05,080 --> 0:11:09,240
It is characteristic of the man who decides that he wants to aggressively

193
0:11:09,240 --> 0:11:12,760
stab his neighbour to death, but not for the man who is hiking and accidentally wanders

194
0:11:12,760 --> 0:11:17,880
on to a farmer's field. mens rea is contrasted with actus reus, meaning guilty act.

195
0:11:17,880 --> 0:11:22,360
Actus reus is present in every man who trespasses, whether they did so knowingly or not.

196
0:11:22,360 --> 0:11:27,000
Restitution can be justified on the grounds of actus reus. Retribution requires mens rea.

197
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:30,720
Here, restitution refers to the act of making a victim whole again. Say I steal 5 ounces of silver

198
0:11:30,720 --> 0:11:34,720
from my neighbour. Restitution would involve me giving my neighbour 5 ounces of silver.

199
0:11:34,720 --> 0:11:39,880
Retribution would involve a further 5 ounces of silver. In total, assuming I knowingly stole, my neighbour

200
0:11:39,880 --> 0:11:46,640
would be due 10 ounces of silver, 5 in restitution and 5 in retribution.

201
0:11:46,640 --> 0:11:50,160
As a point of clarification, mens rea does not require that the person in question actually understands

202
0:11:50,160 --> 0:11:54,440
that their action was criminal. All that is required is that they knowingly perform the invasion.

203
0:11:54,440 --> 0:11:58,720
For instance, the Nazi prison guard who shoots an escaping Jew has knowingly invaded that

204
0:11:58,720 --> 0:12:02,640
Jew's body with his bullet. However, that guard may well believe that his action was

205
0:12:02,640 --> 0:12:07,200
justifiable because he believed in German law, rather the natural law, but his belief

206
0:12:07,200 --> 0:12:11,120
that the action was just does not absolve him, as he knowingly performed that which is objectively an invasion.

207
0:12:11,120 --> 0:12:15,920
With an objective theory of the just means of punishment elucidated,

208
0:12:15,920 --> 0:12:19,800
we shall move on to an analysis of what means of defence are just. Recall that a property

209
0:12:19,800 --> 0:12:24,200
right in X, held by a person A, implies the right of A to exclude other people from the use of X.

210
0:12:24,200 --> 0:12:29,320
It is from this recognition that defence is justified, namely, A is permitted

211
0:12:29,320 --> 0:12:33,600
to use whatever means are required to go about excluding people from X. This simple principle

212
0:12:33,600 --> 0:12:38,000
is, however, not so simple to actually apply to complex scenarios. First, consider the

213
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,720
case of a man trespassing onto your front lawn to take a look at your roses.

214
0:12:41,720 --> 0:12:44,840
It is clear that insofar as you do not wish for him to be there, there is trespassing occurring,

215
0:12:44,840 --> 0:12:47,920
that is he cannot use your lawn to stand on at the same time that you wish for him to

216
0:12:47,920 --> 0:12:51,400
not stand on your lawn. Therefore, you may exclude the man from doing so, but could you

217
0:12:51,400 --> 0:12:55,160
do so through arbitrary means? For instance, would you be permitted to fire a rocket at

218
0:12:55,160 --> 0:12:59,160
his feet, thereby blowing him up, or would you have to take "gentler" means first?

219
0:12:59,160 --> 0:13:03,040
Let's consider the relevant rights. The man owns his body and therefore has a right to exclude

220
0:13:03,040 --> 0:13:07,840
you from his body, but you own your lawn, and thus can exclude him from using your lawn.

221
0:13:07,840 --> 0:13:10,640
Therefore you are permitted to possess him to the extent that it is required to remove

222
0:13:10,640 --> 0:13:14,360
him from your lawn and no more. For instance, perhaps the man did not realise

223
0:13:14,360 --> 0:13:18,280
it was your property, but rather a natural feature that is not owned by anyone.

224
0:13:18,280 --> 0:13:22,160
Here, the man would lack mens rea, and perhaps simply informing him that he is trespassing

225
0:13:22,160 --> 0:13:26,400
will suffice to remove him from your lawn. Here, no possession of his body would be required,

226
0:13:26,400 --> 0:13:29,920
and thus no possession could be justified. However, the man might be stubborn and wish

227
0:13:29,920 --> 0:13:33,920
to look at your roses still. This more stubborn man may require that you grab him by the arm

228
0:13:33,920 --> 0:13:37,440
and walk him off your property. Here, because the grabbing of the arm was required to remove

229
0:13:37,440 --> 0:13:41,760
him, it can be justified. You could not grab his arm and begin stabbing at him with a needle,

230
0:13:41,760 --> 0:13:44,720
as the stabbing with a needle does not serve the purpose of excluding the land from your

231
0:13:44,720 --> 0:13:48,920
property, and is not required for this exclusion. Therefore, this stabbing would be an additional

232
0:13:48,920 --> 0:13:53,160
aggressive invasion of the man, rather than of your lawn. Here, it becomes clear that

233
0:13:53,160 --> 0:13:57,040
you would not be permitted to launch a rocket at the man, unless said launching of a rocket

234
0:13:57,040 --> 0:14:01,280
was required to successfully exclude him. A further example to elaborate upon this principle

235
0:14:01,280 --> 0:14:04,440
is your neighbour kicking his ball onto your lawn. Let's imagine first that your neighbour

236
0:14:04,440 --> 0:14:07,120
doesn't want anyone else to touch his ball, and you don't know what's for the ball

237
0:14:07,120 --> 0:14:10,240
to be on your lawn. Here, the ball is invading your property, so you could justly remove

238
0:14:10,240 --> 0:14:13,360
the ball at will, i.e. you're allowed to exclude the ball from your property, and touching

239
0:14:13,360 --> 0:14:16,480
the ball is required to remove it. Imagine an alternative scenario where the ball is

240
0:14:16,480 --> 0:14:19,200
on your property, and to teach him a lesson, you tell your neighbour that you will not

241
0:14:19,200 --> 0:14:22,640
let him retrieve the ball himself, and you will not remove the ball from your property on your own.

242
0:14:22,640 --> 0:14:25,960
This would be a case of excluding the neighbour from his ball, which you're not

243
0:14:25,960 --> 0:14:29,000
trying to exclude from your property. Because you aren't trying to exclude the ball from

244
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:32,360
your property, it could not be said that the ball has invaded your property. The neighbour

245
0:14:32,360 --> 0:14:36,040
still owns the ball, and therefore you're engaging an act of forestalling. You're excluding

246
0:14:36,040 --> 0:14:39,280
your neighbour from the ball that you do not own. However, if you did attempt to exclude

247
0:14:39,280 --> 0:14:42,720
the ball from your property, perhaps by erecting a fence, and your neighbour was nonetheless

248
0:14:42,720 --> 0:14:46,400
able to overcome your exclusion, the ball is invading your property.

249
0:14:46,400 --> 0:14:49,520
Perhaps this fence completely encloses your property, such that for the neighbor to retrieve his ball

250
0:14:49,520 --> 0:14:53,440
the fence would have to be removed. Certainly, you'd be permitted here to continue to exclude

251
0:14:53,440 --> 0:14:56,800
your neighbour from stepping on to retrieve his ball, as his stepping on to your property

252
0:14:56,800 --> 0:15:00,240
would involve a further invasion, because you're already excluding people from your property

253
0:15:00,240 --> 0:15:04,160
prior to the ball being kicked on. Here the principle is that antecedent rights must prevail.

254
0:15:04,160 --> 0:15:07,920
You're excluding people and balls from your lawn, which is why you own your wall.

255
0:15:07,920 --> 0:15:12,160
You cannot be compelled to allow further invasions to recover from the cost of prior invasions.

256
0:15:12,160 --> 0:15:15,280
Your neighbour must suck it up and hope that you decide to return his ball to him.

257
0:15:15,280 --> 0:15:18,240
This is because your rights to the lawn are antecedent to your neighbour's rights in the ball,

258
0:15:18,240 --> 0:15:21,360
as the ball is used to initiate the conflict. You are rightly allowed to take possession

259
0:15:21,360 --> 0:15:26,080
of his invading ball. Dominiak's contradiction from donut homesteads is resolved here by

260
0:15:26,080 --> 0:15:30,480
your possession of that ball being just. You gain ownership of that ball by virtue of it

261
0:15:30,480 --> 0:15:35,600
being invasive. This is not full-monte ownership, however, like in the case of owning

262
0:15:35,600 --> 0:15:39,760
a stick where you can trade it or use it however you wish, this ownership of the ball would be

263
0:15:39,760 --> 0:15:43,920
specifically for the purpose of excluding invaders from retrieving the ball. If you removed the ball

264
0:15:43,920 --> 0:15:48,080
from your property, it would revert back to the ownership of your neighbour. This analysis applies

265
0:15:48,080 --> 0:15:53,200
also to the cases where a bird drops the ball onto your property, or where a third party kicks the ball,

266
0:15:53,200 --> 0:15:58,640
but not where you kick your neighbour's ball onto your property, as you initiated the conflict

267
0:15:58,640 --> 0:16:02,560
there. The insight that even where your neighbour was not responsible for the invasion of the ball,

268
0:16:02,560 --> 0:16:07,280
you may still take possession of it is key for understanding the libertarian answer to the human

269
0:16:07,280 --> 0:16:10,960
body shield. Consider the case where a criminal steals your neighbour's sword and attempts to

270
0:16:10,960 --> 0:16:15,200
stab you with it, and the only way to prevent this from happening is by damaging the sword.

271
0:16:15,200 --> 0:16:19,920
Because damaging the sword is required in excluding the invasion, it is just, even if your neighbour

272
0:16:19,920 --> 0:16:24,560
does not want the sword to be damaged. Similarly, if the criminal instead picks your neighbour up and

273
0:16:24,560 --> 0:16:29,040
tries to use him as a sword, you'd be justified in damaging your neighbour's body in so far as

274
0:16:29,040 --> 0:16:33,760
this is required to exclude the criminal's invasions.

275
0:16:33,760 --> 0:16:38,000
QUOTE instead of attacking you with stolen property, the criminal instead shields himself with stolen

276
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:42,160
property. For example, say the criminal wraps himself and your neighbour's quilt, approaches

277
0:16:42,160 --> 0:16:46,800
you and then begins shooting at you. As you take cover and draw your side arm, your neighbour yells,

278
0:16:46,800 --> 0:16:50,880
END QUOTE don't shoot my quilt, as a libertarian must you respect the preference of your neighbour,

279
0:16:50,880 --> 0:16:55,600
In such a scenario, you'd be justified in taking whatever actions are required

280
0:16:55,600 --> 0:16:59,680
to exclude the criminal's attempted invasion as always.

281
0:16:59,680 --> 0:17:05,120
It is required that you shoot back in order to thwart him. Thus, this is just.

282
0:17:05,120 --> 0:17:09,040
Even though it would imply damaging your neighbour's quilt, moreover, your neighbour would not be

283
0:17:09,040 --> 0:17:13,760
justified in attacking you to defend his quilt. You are doing no wrong by shooting through the quilt.

284
0:17:13,760 --> 0:17:18,080
Therefore, your neighbour cannot justify attacking you, as he is not responding to an aggression on

285
0:17:18,080 --> 0:17:22,560
your part. We can then trivially move from the criminal using a quilt shield to one using your

286
0:17:22,560 --> 0:17:26,960
neighbour as a shield. Again, you are justified in shooting back at the criminal,

287
0:17:26,960 --> 0:17:31,040
even if this implies shooting through your neighbour.

288
0:17:31,040 --> 0:17:34,480
QUOTE had connected to device to your neighbour that would kill him if the criminal were to die.

289
0:17:34,480 --> 0:17:38,880
If you defend yourself against the criminal, then your neighbour will suffer. Yet, as in the previous

290
0:17:38,880 --> 0:17:43,120
case, your rights are antecedent to those of your neighbour. The aggressor brought his property into

291
0:17:43,120 --> 0:17:46,800
conflict. The violation of your neighbour's property rights occurs when the criminal connects

292
0:17:46,800 --> 0:17:51,200
the device to him, and when the criminal attacks you, not when you killed the criminal. Furthermore,

293
0:17:51,200 --> 0:17:55,200
END QUOTE your neighbour would not be justified in attacking you to try and prevent you from killing the criminal.

294
0:17:55,200 --> 0:17:58,560
This is distinct from the situation where your neighbour is a bystander to the aggression.

295
0:17:58,560 --> 0:18:02,160
In such a situation, attacking him is not required to exclude the aggressive

296
0:18:02,160 --> 0:18:06,160
invasions from the criminal, so randomly turning around and shooting at him during the gunfight

297
0:18:06,160 --> 0:18:10,320
would be an additional aggression insofar as this is not required to thwart the bad guy.

298
0:18:10,320 --> 0:18:14,080
The same is true if you are given an ultimatum by the criminal, where he will shoot you if you

299
0:18:14,080 --> 0:18:19,040
do not kill your neighbour. You are allowed only to engage in exclusionary actions against the aggressor,

300
0:18:19,040 --> 0:18:24,480
not against bystanders. These exclusionary actions may well damage the property of third parties,

301
0:18:24,480 --> 0:18:29,040
this is not provide carte blanche for whatever invasions you may wish to engage in, to exclude,

302
0:18:29,040 --> 0:18:33,920
to clarify exclusion is only justified against aggressors. However, exclusion against aggressor

303
0:18:33,920 --> 0:18:38,400
may or may not involve damage to the property of third parties. This damage can only be

304
0:18:38,400 --> 0:18:50,640
justified if it is required to exclude the aggressor.
