0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:18,640
7. An elaboration on the nature of law as a subset of ethics

2
0:00:18,640 --> 0:00:23,440
Value is objective, not intrinsic or subjective. Value is based on and derives from the facts

3
0:00:23,440 --> 0:00:28,480
of reality. It is not derived from mystic authority or from whim, personal or social.

4
0:00:28,480 --> 0:00:32,960
Reality we hold, along with the decision to remain in it, i.e. to stay alive, dictates and demands

5
0:00:32,960 --> 0:00:37,760
the entire code of values. Unlike the lower species, man does not pursue the proper values

6
0:00:37,760 --> 0:00:42,320
automatically. He must discover and choose them, but this does not imply subjectivism.

7
0:00:42,320 --> 0:00:46,880
Every proper value judgement is the identification of a fact. A given object or action advances

8
0:00:46,880 --> 0:00:51,680
man's life. It is good, or it threatens man's life. It is bad, or an evil. The good, therefore,

9
0:00:51,680 --> 0:00:56,880
is a species of the true. It is a form of recognising reality. The evil is a species of the false.

10
0:00:56,880 --> 0:01:01,280
It is a form of contradicting reality. Or, values are a type of fact. They are facts

11
0:01:01,280 --> 0:01:05,680
considered in relation to the choice to live. Existentially, an action of man is good or bad

12
0:01:05,680 --> 0:01:10,240
according to its effect. Its effect is positive or negative on man's life. Thus, creating a

13
0:01:10,240 --> 0:01:15,040
skyscraper is good, and murdering the architect is bad, both by the standard of life. A human

14
0:01:15,040 --> 0:01:18,880
action is not merely physical motion. It is a product of man's ideas and value judgments,

15
0:01:18,880 --> 0:01:22,160
true or false, which themselves drive from a certain kind of mental cause,

16
0:01:22,160 --> 0:01:26,240
ultimately from thought or from evasion. The skyscraper's creator, function on the basis

17
0:01:26,240 --> 0:01:30,080
of proper value judgments and true ideas, including a complex, specialised knowledge.

18
0:01:30,080 --> 0:01:33,920
So you must have expended mental effort, focus, work. So one praises him morally

19
0:01:33,920 --> 0:01:37,760
and admires him. But the murderer acted on ideas of value judgments that defy reality.

20
0:01:37,760 --> 0:01:41,920
So you must have evaded and practised whim worship. So one condemns him morally and despises him.

0:01:42,880 --> 0:01:43,680
Leonard Peikoff

22
0:01:44,720 --> 0:01:48,160
In the preparation for and the writing of this course, I have encountered a strange tendency,

23
0:01:48,160 --> 0:01:51,520
wherein the claim that people ought not violate the rights of others is apparently a controversial

24
0:01:51,520 --> 0:01:55,360
one, even among Austrians. This is indicative of a severe problem in Austro-libertarian

25
0:01:55,360 --> 0:01:58,400
circles that deserves a dedicated section of this course to properly address.

26
0:01:58,400 --> 0:02:02,240
The root for this problem is that many reject the core definition of law as a subset of ethics,

27
0:02:02,240 --> 0:02:05,920
claiming instead that there is such a thing as a virtuous crime. The paragon example would be a

28
0:02:05,920 --> 0:02:09,680
man who is about to commit suicide by jumping off of a cliff. And the only way to save this man

29
0:02:09,680 --> 0:02:12,880
is to violate his rights by grabbing him and dragging him away from the cliff's edge.

30
0:02:12,880 --> 0:02:16,880
These contextualist-libertarians would have it that whether a crime is moral or not depends on

31
0:02:16,880 --> 0:02:21,120
extra-legal context. I believe much of the confusion on this topic stems from the fact that many

32
0:02:21,120 --> 0:02:25,120
libertarians at least appear to be somewhat inconsistent. At some points indicating that law

33
0:02:25,120 --> 0:02:29,120
is indeed a subset of ethics and at other points rejecting this position. Rothbard explicitly

34
0:02:29,120 --> 0:02:33,280
states his work on pollution, that law is a subset of ethics and a set of ought or normative

35
0:02:33,280 --> 0:02:37,120
propositions. But his discussion of lifeboat scenarios in The Ethics of Liberty, is commonly

36
0:02:37,120 --> 0:02:41,200
cited to negate this point. Rothbard presents the conundrum as follows:

37
0:02:41,200 --> 0:02:45,680
QUOTE that the existence of extreme or lifeboat situations disproves any theory of absolute property rights,

38
0:02:45,680 --> 0:02:49,760
or indeed of any absolute rights of self-ownership whatsoever. It is claimed that since any theory

39
0:02:49,760 --> 0:02:53,680
of individual rights seems to break down or works unsatisfactorily in such fortunately rare

40
0:02:53,680 --> 0:02:58,000
situations, therefore there can be no concept of inviolable rights at all. In a typical lifeboat

41
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,920
situation there are, let us say, eight places in a lifeboat putting out from a sinking ship,

42
0:03:01,920 --> 0:03:05,360
END QUOTE and there are more than eight people wishing to be saved. Who then is to decide who should

43
0:03:05,360 --> 0:03:09,120
On its face, this appears to not present any serious problem to

44
0:03:09,120 --> 0:03:12,640
the theory presented in this course. The fact that the truth of the matter is unsatisfactory

45
0:03:12,640 --> 0:03:16,720
or makes someone upset or look like a bad guy for presenting it does not constitute a refutation

46
0:03:16,720 --> 0:03:21,440
of said truth. Indeed, to warp one's ethics to suit one's intuition such that any "unsatisfactory"

47
0:03:21,440 --> 0:03:25,200
results are purged would be to surrender oneself to accepting the mystic power of whim to grant

48
0:03:25,200 --> 0:03:29,520
truth, thus tainting an otherwise sound epistemology, thus I shall proceed with the analysis without

49
0:03:29,520 --> 0:03:33,600
caring about how nasty-sounding the conclusion reached may be. In the first place we have a scarcity,

50
0:03:33,600 --> 0:03:37,600
only eight spots in a lifeboat and more than eight people, thus property rights must be assigned.

51
0:03:37,600 --> 0:03:41,520
Presumably this lifeboat did not materialise in nature and was instead built by or purchased

52
0:03:41,520 --> 0:03:45,680
by whomever owns the boat, thus it is he who gets the right to say who gets a spot, perhaps he makes

53
0:03:45,680 --> 0:03:49,840
a rule that women and children go first, perhaps he decides that crewmates get priority over customers

54
0:03:49,840 --> 0:03:54,400
and so on. Whatever arbitrary rules he sets ought be abided. Now what of the situation where the

55
0:03:54,400 --> 0:03:58,320
owner set no rules forth and has died abandoning lifeboat to the domain of nature? We surely

56
0:03:58,320 --> 0:04:02,720
have our solution in the homesteading principle. First come, first served. If you get to a spot in the

57
0:04:02,720 --> 0:04:07,040
lifeboat you're thus using said spot and thus get to dictate how it is to be used. Presumably

58
0:04:07,040 --> 0:04:10,800
you want it to be used to save yourself. This might be horribly unfair to those who are slower or

59
0:04:10,800 --> 0:04:14,800
started further away from the lifeboat, but tough luck! Life isn't fair and neither is law.

60
0:04:14,800 --> 0:04:19,360
The prime goal of law is justice, not fairness. What, after all, would be the alternative? That

61
0:04:19,360 --> 0:04:22,960
people who are slower to get to the boat, i.e. late comers are the ones who should get a spot?

62
0:04:22,960 --> 0:04:26,160
Well, then the people they kick out could just immediately return to the boat as an even later

63
0:04:26,160 --> 0:04:29,920
comer, thus entering us into an endless dance of groups getting in and out of the boat.

64
0:04:29,920 --> 0:04:33,680
Everyone would be equal, but everyone would be dead. It seems that Rothbard came to the same conclusion:

65
0:04:33,680 --> 0:04:37,520
QUOTE If the owner of the boat, or his representative, e.g. the captain of the ship,

66
0:04:37,520 --> 0:04:41,600
has died in the wreck, and if he has not laid down no rules in advance of the wreck for allocation

67
0:04:41,600 --> 0:04:45,280
of seats in such a crisis, then the lifeboat may be considered at least temporarily for the

68
0:04:45,280 --> 0:04:49,360
emergency, abandoned, and therefore unowned. At this point, our rules for unowned property

69
0:04:49,360 --> 0:04:53,360
come into play, namely that unowned resources become the property of the first people possessing

70
0:04:53,360 --> 0:04:57,280
them. In short, the first eight people to reach the boat are, in our theory, the proper owners

71
0:04:57,280 --> 0:05:00,960
and users of the boat. Anyone who throws them out of the boat then commits an act of aggression

72
0:05:00,960 --> 0:05:04,720
in violating the property right of the homesteader he throws out of the boat. After he returns to

73
0:05:04,720 --> 0:05:08,640
shore, then the aggressive becomes liable for prosecution for his act of violation of property

74
0:05:08,640 --> 0:05:11,920
right, as well, perhaps for the murder of the person he rejected out of the boat.

75
0:05:11,920 --> 0:05:15,440
Rothbard continues with the following. In the first place, a lifeboat situation is hardly a

76
0:05:15,440 --> 0:05:19,040
valid test of a theory of rights, or any moral theory whatsoever. Problems of moral theory

77
0:05:19,040 --> 0:05:23,040
in such an extreme situation do not invalidate a theory in normal situations. In any sphere of

78
0:05:23,040 --> 0:05:26,960
moral theory, we are trying to affirm an ethic for man, based on his nature and the nature of the

79
0:05:26,960 --> 0:05:31,760
world, and this precisely means for normal nature, for the way life usually is, and not for rare or

80
0:05:31,760 --> 0:05:36,560
abnormal situations, is a wise maxim of law for precisely this reason that hard cases make bad

81
0:05:36,560 --> 0:05:40,320
law. We are trying to frame an ethic for the way men generally live in the world. We are not,

82
0:05:40,320 --> 0:05:43,920
after all, interested in framing an ethic that focuses on situations that are rare, extreme,

83
0:05:43,920 --> 0:05:47,360
and not generally encountered. Let's take an example to illustrate their point.

84
0:05:47,360 --> 0:05:50,800
Outside the sphere of property rights, or rights in general, and within the sphere of ordinary

85
0:05:50,800 --> 0:05:54,560
ethical values. Most people would concede the principle that it is ethical for a parent to save

86
0:05:54,560 --> 0:05:59,040
his child from drowning, but then our lifeboat skeptic could arise, and our all is challenged.

87
0:05:59,040 --> 0:06:02,320
Aha, but suppose that two of your children are drowning, and you can only save one. Which

88
0:06:02,320 --> 0:06:05,600
child would you choose? And doesn't the fact that you'd have to let one child die and they get the

89
0:06:05,600 --> 0:06:08,960
very moral principle that you should save your drowning child? I doubt whether many ethicists

90
0:06:08,960 --> 0:06:12,560
would throw over the moral desirability or principle of saving one's child because it

91
0:06:12,560 --> 0:06:16,480
END QUOTEcould not be fully applied in such a lifeboat situation. Yet why should the lifeboat case be

92
0:06:16,480 --> 0:06:20,160
The response here indicates that there are at least two different spheres of ethics.

93
0:06:20,160 --> 0:06:25,120
One for normal situations, and one for abnormal ones. It is not clear, however,

94
0:06:25,120 --> 0:06:28,480
how on earth it could be possible to make a non-arbitrary distinction between normal and

95
0:06:28,480 --> 0:06:32,320
abnormal ethical conundrums. Moreover, as such a principled distinction cannot be made between

96
0:06:32,320 --> 0:06:36,240
normal and abnormal such a theory be particularistic and thus irrational. That is to say, there are

97
0:06:36,240 --> 0:06:40,160
certainly many differences that one could use to define normal as opposed to abnormal. Say that

98
0:06:40,160 --> 0:06:44,000
situations where red shirts are worn are abnormal, and the ones where red shirts are not worn,

99
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,840
the situation is normal. That would be a difference, but the difference is not relevant to ethical

100
0:06:47,840 --> 0:06:52,480
theory. Thus a rational norm must apply to both classes of situations in order to be universal,

101
0:06:52,480 --> 0:06:56,080
as opposed to particular. Until such a principled difference can be found to define normal as

102
0:06:56,080 --> 0:07:00,240
opposed to abnormal, we are stuck with universal norms having to apply to both classes, and thus

103
0:07:00,240 --> 0:07:03,840
there are not two "spheres" of moral theory. That is to say, it couldn't be the case that

104
0:07:03,840 --> 0:07:08,400
property rights hold normally, but not abnormally. Such would be a particularistic property norm,

105
0:07:08,400 --> 0:07:12,240
and thus an irrational one. I must now consider Rothbard's drowning children hypothetical.

106
0:07:12,240 --> 0:07:15,440
In the case of a single child, it is assumed that parent can save them, and in the case of

107
0:07:15,440 --> 0:07:19,040
two children it is assumed that only one can be saved. There are indeed certain similarities

108
0:07:19,040 --> 0:07:22,560
between the drowning children and Lifeboat, so the case of two children, one will die, and one will

109
0:07:22,560 --> 0:07:26,160
live. For the Lifeboat, eight will live, and others will die. The question is how to determine

110
0:07:26,160 --> 0:07:29,120
who should live and who should die. We have our solution in the case of the Lifeboat,

111
0:07:29,120 --> 0:07:32,080
and it strikes me that this course provides a similar ability to answer the drowning children

112
0:07:32,080 --> 0:07:35,840
hypothetical. The mother cannot physically save both, and thus it is surely a matter of personal

113
0:07:35,840 --> 0:07:39,440
preference which one she saves. And why should she be expected to act any differently? It would

114
0:07:39,440 --> 0:07:43,200
be logically impossible for her to pick the one that she would prefer not to save, and thus the

115
0:07:43,200 --> 0:07:46,880
only alternative would be to let both drown. Surely we can easily sum this up in a universal

116
0:07:46,880 --> 0:07:50,480
principle. Guardians ought save their children from drowning insofar as they have the ability

117
0:07:50,480 --> 0:07:53,840
to. It is not my claim that this principle has been proven, after all this is a law course,

118
0:07:53,840 --> 0:07:57,200
not a course on ethics in general, but I can't see how this would not be universal,

119
0:07:57,200 --> 0:08:01,120
and it certainly seems that it easily deals with Rothbard's hypothetical opponent.

120
0:08:01,120 --> 0:08:05,760
Rothbard seemingly goes forth with his multi-sphere model:

121
0:08:05,760 --> 0:08:09,120
to our theory as follows. That theory of property rights, or even of self-ownership,

122
0:08:09,120 --> 0:08:12,640
is driveable from the conditions by which man survives and flourishes in this world,

123
0:08:12,640 --> 0:08:16,400
and that therefore, in this kind of extreme situation, or mass faced with the choice of either

124
0:08:16,400 --> 0:08:20,240
saving himself or violating the property rights of the Lifeboat owner, or in the above example of

125
0:08:20,240 --> 0:08:23,920
the homesteader of the boat, and it is ridiculous to expect him to surrender his life on behalf

126
0:08:23,920 --> 0:08:27,280
of the abstract principle of property rights. Because of this kind of consideration, many

127
0:08:27,280 --> 0:08:30,720
libertarians who otherwise believe in property rights gravely weaken them on behalf of the

128
0:08:30,720 --> 0:08:34,560
contextualist contention that, given a choice between his life and a grazing against someone

129
0:08:34,560 --> 0:08:38,000
else's property or even life, it is moral for him to commit the aggression, and that therefore,

130
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,440
in such a situation, these property rights cease to exist. The error here on the part of

131
0:08:41,440 --> 0:08:44,800
the contentious libertarian is to confuse the question of the moral course of action for the

132
0:08:44,800 --> 0:08:48,560
person in such a tragic situation, with a totally separate question of whether or not his seizing

133
0:08:48,560 --> 0:08:52,320
of Lifeboat or Planck Space by force constitutes an invasion of someone else's property right,

134
0:08:52,320 --> 0:08:56,240
for we are not in constructing a theory of liberty and property, i.e. a political ethic,

135
0:08:56,240 --> 0:09:00,240
concerned with all personal moral principles. We are not here with concern whether it is moral

136
0:09:00,240 --> 0:09:04,640
or immoral for someone to lie, to be a good person, to develop his faculties, or be kind or mean to

137
0:09:04,640 --> 0:09:08,560
his neighbours. We are concerned in this sort of discussion solely with such political ethical

138
0:09:08,560 --> 0:09:12,640
questions as the proper rule of violence, the sphere of rights, or the definitions of criminality

139
0:09:12,640 --> 0:09:16,160
and aggression. Whether or not it is moral or immoral for Smith, the fellow excluded by the

140
0:09:16,160 --> 0:09:19,440
owner from the Planck or the Lifeboat, to force someone else out of the Lifeboat or whether he

141
0:09:19,440 --> 0:09:23,520
END QUOTE should die heroically instead, is not our concern and not the proper concern of a theory of political

142
0:09:23,520 --> 0:09:27,520
On a first glance, it would seem that Rothbard is adopting a dichotomy between law and ethics,

143
0:09:27,520 --> 0:09:31,520
and this passage would mean sighted to me numerous times to that effect. But to my eye, this is only

144
0:09:31,520 --> 0:09:35,040
one of multiple valid interpretations of Rothbard's writing here. It appears to me that he is merely

145
0:09:35,040 --> 0:09:38,800
hedging his bets and ignoring the questions of ethics as a whole and focusing in on the area

146
0:09:38,800 --> 0:09:42,800
that he has expertise in. This highlights why Rothbard saw fit to analyse the Lifeboat scenario

147
0:09:42,800 --> 0:09:47,440
to "ordinary ethical values;" if law was not a subset of ethics, i.e. if it did not deal with

148
0:09:47,440 --> 0:09:51,840
ought statements, such an analogy would be incoherent. Furthermore, Rothbard is correct here that we

149
0:09:51,840 --> 0:09:56,000
are not, in constructing a theory of liberty and property, concerned with all personal moral

150
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,840
principles. We are rather only concerned with those moral principles that pertain to conflicts

151
0:09:59,840 --> 0:10:04,560
over scarce means. This does not, as the critics claim, demonstrate that law and ethics are disconnected

152
0:10:04,560 --> 0:10:08,320
fields. Clearly, if we are concerned with a subset of all moral principles which deals specifically

153
0:10:08,320 --> 0:10:13,120
with conflicts in doing law, then law itself is a subset of morality in general. This analysis is

154
0:10:13,120 --> 0:10:16,480
also consistent with Rothbard's claim that whether or not it is moral or immoral for Smith,

155
0:10:16,480 --> 0:10:19,840
the fellow excluded by the owner from the plank or the Lifeboat, to force someone else out of the

156
0:10:19,840 --> 0:10:23,840
Lifeboat, or whether he should die heroically instead, is not our concern and not the proper

157
0:10:23,840 --> 0:10:27,520
concern of a theory of political ethics. It very much appears to me that Rothbard is merely leaving

158
0:10:27,520 --> 0:10:31,360
the floor open for his legal theory to be compatible with any outside ethical theory that one may come

159
0:10:31,360 --> 0:10:35,840
up with, even one which would allow for contradictions between "personal" and "political" ethics. Of course,

160
0:10:35,840 --> 0:10:39,840
such a theory would be false, but that is not the concern of Rothbard qua legal theorist.

161
0:10:39,840 --> 0:10:43,760
This becomes clear in a footnote attached to the end of the above paragraph, commenting on an example

162
0:10:43,760 --> 0:10:47,120
where two men are floating in the water and there's a plank that can save only one of them:

163
0:10:47,120 --> 0:10:50,480
QUOTE Eric Mack's example fails to show a necessary conflict between property rights and moral

164
0:10:50,480 --> 0:10:54,080
principles. The conflict in his example is between property rights and the dictates of prudence

165
0:10:54,080 --> 0:10:58,000
or self-interest, but the latter is only dominated morality if one adopts moral equalism,

166
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,760
END QUOTE which indeed Professor Mack does, but which is only one possible moral theory.

167
0:11:01,760 --> 0:11:05,920
This makes it abundantly clear to me that Rothbard is, as I claim, simply trying to make his ethic as narrow

168
0:11:05,920 --> 0:11:10,400
as possible such that it may be slotted into any general ethical theory.

169
0:11:10,400 --> 0:11:14,000
QUOTE The crucial point is that even if the contextualist libertarians may say that,

170
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:18,480
given the tragic context, Smith should throw someone else out of the lifeboat to save his own life,

171
0:11:18,480 --> 0:11:22,880
he is still committing, at the very least, invasion of property rights, and probably also

172
0:11:22,880 --> 0:11:26,640
murder of the person thrown out, so that even if one says that he should try and save his life

173
0:11:26,640 --> 0:11:31,120
by forcibly grabbing a seat in the lifeboat, he is still, in our view, liable to prosecution as

174
0:11:31,120 --> 0:11:35,360
a criminal invader of property right, and perhaps as a murderer as well. After he's convicted,

175
0:11:35,360 --> 0:11:39,440
it would be the right of the lifeboat owner or the heir of the person tossed out to forgive Smith,

176
0:11:39,440 --> 0:11:43,520
to pardon him because of the unusual circumstances, but it would also be the right not to pardon

177
0:11:43,520 --> 0:11:47,200
and to proceed with the full force of their legal right to punish. Once again, we are concerned in

178
0:11:47,200 --> 0:11:51,120
this theory with the rights of the case, not, with whether or not a person chooses to voluntarily

179
0:11:51,120 --> 0:11:54,720
exercise his rights. In our view, the property owner or the heir of the killed would have the

180
0:11:54,720 --> 0:11:59,200
right to prosecute and to exact proper punishment upon the aggressor. The fallacy of the contextualists

181
0:11:59,200 --> 0:12:02,880
is to confuse considerations of individual personal morality, what should Smith do,

182
0:12:02,880 --> 0:12:06,800
END QUOTE with the question of the rights of the case. The right to property continues, then, to be absolute,

183
0:12:06,800 --> 0:12:10,880
Again, Rothbard's use of the even if disclaimer prior to the hypothetical proof

184
0:12:10,880 --> 0:12:14,640
that Smith should throw someone out of the lifeboat is a crystal-clear

185
0:12:14,640 --> 0:12:18,720
signal that Rothbard is merely entertaining this as a hypothetical counter to his thesis.

186
0:12:18,720 --> 0:12:22,320
What Rothbard has done is that he is shown his theory of property rights to hold, even if

187
0:12:22,320 --> 0:12:25,600
someone were to prove that there are separate personal and political spheres of ethics.

188
0:12:25,600 --> 0:12:29,840
To reiterate, Rothbard has not here accepted that there is indeed such a proof, all he has done

189
0:12:29,840 --> 0:12:33,440
is shown that the existence of such a proof is irrelevant to his legal theory. Of course,

190
0:12:33,440 --> 0:12:37,280
such a proof does not exist, as said multi-sphere ethics would be a polylogism.

191
0:12:37,280 --> 0:12:41,680
Ought is ought, there is not ought-but-personal, and a separate ought-but-political, there is only ought.

192
0:12:41,680 --> 0:12:45,520
Confusion on this matter comes down to colloquial usage of the word ought. In sentences like,

193
0:12:45,520 --> 0:12:48,560
you ought wear a coat because you don't want to get wet. There are two ways we can interpret

194
0:12:48,560 --> 0:12:51,760
this statement. Either we assume that ought is being used in its precise logical meaning,

195
0:12:51,760 --> 0:12:55,120
or we assume it is being used as prudential advice. In the former case, the statement is

196
0:12:55,120 --> 0:12:58,160
simply invalid. It does not follow from the fact that a person doesn't want to get wet,

197
0:12:58,160 --> 0:13:01,280
that they ought prevent themselves from getting wet by wearing a coat. After all,

198
0:13:01,280 --> 0:13:04,880
I may want to rape a baby, but it does not follow from the existence of this whim that I actually

199
0:13:04,880 --> 0:13:08,720
ought obey it. The latter interpretation of ought being a prudential advice is a colloquial

200
0:13:08,720 --> 0:13:12,560
usage of the word. What is really being said is, if you do not want to get wet, wearing a coat

201
0:13:12,560 --> 0:13:16,480
will achieve this goal, which is clearly an is statement. All that is being said is that the

202
0:13:16,480 --> 0:13:20,480
given strategy will attain the goal, not whether the goal is proper. Thus, it could not be that

203
0:13:20,480 --> 0:13:25,040
politically you ought not aggress but personally you ought aggress, as that would be a contradiction.

204
0:13:25,040 --> 0:13:28,640
You ought aggress, and you ought not aggress. Then it appears to me that Rothbard holds law

205
0:13:28,640 --> 0:13:32,240
as a subset of ethics, but has also successfully shielded his theory from any attack which would

206
0:13:32,240 --> 0:13:36,240
seek to separate them. This stance becomes confusing in the light of modern Austrian theorists.

207
0:13:36,240 --> 0:13:40,480
Hoppe has shown with his argumentation ethics that any attempt at negating the NAP leads to contradiction,

208
0:13:40,480 --> 0:13:43,920
but elsewhere claims that he was not attempting to drive an ought from an is, but surely if an

209
0:13:43,920 --> 0:13:48,000
ought statement which negates the NAP falls into contradiction, its negation must be true? This

210
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:51,600
will be analysed in greater depth below, but for now the contextualist counter-thesis to my

211
0:13:51,600 --> 0:13:55,360
position is summed up explicitly by Konrad Graf:

212
0:13:55,360 --> 0:13:59,280
QUOTE praxeology enables its reconstruction as a categorical and definitional assessment of what

213
0:13:59,280 --> 0:14:03,440
types of actions are NAP infringements, separate from moral assessment of such infringements.

214
0:14:03,440 --> 0:14:07,600
In this view, an example of an ethical statement would be one or not violate rights. Legal theory

215
0:14:07,600 --> 0:14:11,600
END QUOTEhelps us to make this go actionable by supplying information concerning the question, what is

216
0:14:11,600 --> 0:14:15,200
And what, then, does it mean to violate a right? As I'm sure Konrad would agree,

217
0:14:15,200 --> 0:14:18,560
it means that you could not justify your conduct, but what does it mean that you cannot justify

218
0:14:18,560 --> 0:14:22,560
your conduct? It means that you cannot claim that your conduct should go forth, as said claim

219
0:14:22,560 --> 0:14:27,120
implies a contradiction. Thus, its negation that your conduct should not go forth is true.

220
0:14:27,120 --> 0:14:32,800
This is a legal claim and an ethical one. In fact, every legal claim is also an ethical claim,

221
0:14:32,800 --> 0:14:37,120
as every legal claim is a claim about which party should have possession in the conflict at hand.

222
0:14:37,120 --> 0:14:40,960
QUOTE There is an intuitive relationship between law and ethics. However, I argue that it is not one

223
0:14:40,960 --> 0:14:45,040
of a field to a subfield, but rather of an advisor relationship between two distinct fields.

224
0:14:45,040 --> 0:14:49,680
If one takes on the moral objective of not agressing, one is more likely to be successful at this in

225
0:14:49,680 --> 0:14:53,760
action, with a clear idea of what aggression is. Rights and statements become one category of

226
0:14:53,760 --> 0:14:57,920
wrongs next to other non-legal categories of wrongs that a given ethical system may specify.

227
0:14:57,920 --> 0:15:01,840
Yet the definition of what constitutes infringing rights is derived independently of ethics using

228
0:15:01,840 --> 0:15:06,400
the categorical, counterfactual method of praxeology. Although argumentation ethics establishes that

229
0:15:06,400 --> 0:15:10,320
END QUOTE no propositional argument against the NAP can succeed, it does not prevent human beings from

230
0:15:10,320 --> 0:15:14,080
Indeed, Konrad is correct that argumentation ethics does not

231
0:15:14,080 --> 0:15:17,280
prevent people from engaging in aggression, but it does demonstrate that any attempted

232
0:15:17,280 --> 0:15:20,800
justification of that aggression would fall into contradiction. That is to say, any claim that

233
0:15:20,800 --> 0:15:25,920
one ought agress implies a contradiction, thus its negation that one ought not agress is true,

234
0:15:25,920 --> 0:15:29,520
just as the fact that one plus one makes two does not prevent people from acting erroneously

235
0:15:29,520 --> 0:15:33,040
on the thought that it actually makes three, so two does the fact that aggression is evil,

236
0:15:33,040 --> 0:15:36,400
not prevent people from erroneously acting on the thought that it is good. Furthermore,

237
0:15:36,400 --> 0:15:41,440
Konrad himself states that the NAP forms the outer boundary of justifiability for any norm or rule.

238
0:15:41,440 --> 0:15:45,520
This is because any norm in contradiction to the NAP is simply incoherent via the nature of

239
0:15:45,520 --> 0:15:50,720
justification as such. Law is pointless it is not a subset of ethics. A is a crime, but so what?

240
0:15:50,720 --> 0:15:53,760
What does it mean to have a right if it doesn't mean that it should not be violated? Could one

241
0:15:53,760 --> 0:15:58,000
accept wholesale the NAP and the entire Rothbardian politics, whilst agreeing with every ethical

242
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:02,160
prescription we hear from the Marxists? If ethics and the law merely intersect, where do the intersect

243
0:16:02,160 --> 0:16:05,840
and why not elsewhere? What are those rights that should be violated and in what sense are they even

244
0:16:05,840 --> 0:16:09,840
rights if they shouldn't be respected? A favorite quote of the ethics and law separators comes from Hoppe himself

245
0:16:09,840 --> 0:16:13,840
QUOTE, who states, the praxeological proof of libertarianism has the advantage of

246
0:16:13,840 --> 0:16:17,360
offering a completely value free justification of private property, it remains entirely in the

247
0:16:17,360 --> 0:16:21,200
realm of his statements and never tries to derive an alt from an is. The structure of this argument

248
0:16:21,200 --> 0:16:25,840
is this. A, justification is propositional justification, a priori true is statement.

249
0:16:25,840 --> 0:16:29,680
B, argumentation presupposes property in one's body and the homesteading principle,

250
0:16:29,680 --> 0:16:35,280
a priori true is statement. And C, then no deviation from this ethic can be argumentatively justified,

251
0:16:35,280 --> 0:16:39,200
a priori true is statement. The proof also offers a key to an understanding of the nature of the

252
0:16:39,200 --> 0:16:42,800
fact of value dichotomy. Ought statements cannot be derived from his statements, they belong to

253
0:16:42,800 --> 0:16:46,560
different logical realms. It is also clear, however, that one cannot even state that there are facts

254
0:16:46,560 --> 0:16:50,720
and values if no propositional exchanges exist. And at this practice of propositional exchanges,

255
0:16:50,720 --> 0:16:54,880
in turn, presupposes the acceptance of the private property ethic as valid. In other words,

256
0:16:54,880 --> 0:16:58,800
END QUOTE cognition and truth seeking as such have a normative foundation, and the normative foundation on

257
0:16:58,800 --> 0:17:03,040
Hoppe is indeed correct that his above syllogism as not of the form

258
0:17:03,040 --> 0:17:07,280
is-statement, is-statement, therefore, ought-statement. But those in the Konrad camp

259
0:17:07,280 --> 0:17:11,040
are incorrect to conclude from this that argumentation ethics fails to demonstrate

260
0:17:11,040 --> 0:17:15,120
the truth and falsehood of different ought statements, as Hoppe himself stated in that very passage,

261
0:17:15,120 --> 0:17:20,160
recognition of the private property ethic aka the NAP, as valid, is a precondition for arguing

262
0:17:20,160 --> 0:17:23,920
over anything. Thus, to try and dispute the NAP, you have to first accept that it is true,

263
0:17:23,920 --> 0:17:28,480
giving it the axiomatic status just as surely as the action axiom or the law of non-contradiction.

264
0:17:28,480 --> 0:17:32,160
Furthermore, we can use a conclusion of Hoppe's above syllogism to construct a new syllogism.

265
0:17:32,160 --> 0:17:36,800
1. I ought engage in aggression X implies a contradiction. A priori true is statement.

266
0:17:36,800 --> 0:17:39,840
2. Contradictions are false. A priori true is statement.

267
0:17:39,840 --> 0:17:44,640
In other words, the negation of the NAP implies a contradiction. Therefore, the negation of

268
0:17:44,640 --> 0:17:48,720
the negation of the NAP, which is the NAP, is true. But how could this be if

269
0:17:48,720 --> 0:17:53,120
fact and values "belong to different logical realms?"

270
0:17:53,120 --> 0:17:57,680
The issue we come to with this view is a dogmatic application of Hume's guillotine,

271
0:17:57,680 --> 0:18:01,520
also called the fact-value dichotomy. The claim is that it is impossible to

272
0:18:01,520 --> 0:18:05,760
drive an ought from an is, but clearly I have done just that. The negation of the NAP is an

273
0:18:05,760 --> 0:18:09,920
ought statement that implies a contradiction. Contradictions are false, therefore the NAP is true.

274
0:18:09,920 --> 0:18:13,840
It is a true ought statement. However, you want to describe this, whether I have sidesteped or

275
0:18:13,840 --> 0:18:17,920
transcended or ploughed straight through Hume's guillotine. The fact remains that there are true

276
0:18:17,920 --> 0:18:22,560
values, and thus there is no dichotomy between facts and values. This statement is incredibly

277
0:18:22,560 --> 0:18:26,320
controversial in the face of modern subjectivist philosophy. Where insofar as ethics is even

278
0:18:26,320 --> 0:18:29,680
thought about, it is dismissed out of hand as a mere description of what people want to do.

279
0:18:29,680 --> 0:18:33,840
But of course, saying that person A wants to do X over not X is the claim that A thinks he

280
0:18:33,840 --> 0:18:38,880
should pick X over not X when given the chance. That is to say, a preference for X over not X

281
0:18:38,880 --> 0:18:43,920
is itself an ethical claim, so choice itself has value implications. I imagine almost everyone

282
0:18:43,920 --> 0:18:47,920
takes the is-ought gap for granted, thus I will take some time to further elaborate on why the fact

283
0:18:47,920 --> 0:18:52,400
value dichotomy does not exist. First, values in the ethical sense are not arbitrary.

284
0:18:52,400 --> 0:18:56,160
Insofar as a person is engaging in any form of evaluation or making some argument or acting

285
0:18:56,160 --> 0:19:00,320
at all, he is necessarily making the choice of existence over non-existence. That is to say,

286
0:19:00,320 --> 0:19:04,240
to remain in reality, to claim anything to be correct at all, he must hold life as a value.

287
0:19:04,240 --> 0:19:08,160
To negate the value of life would be to immediately contradict oneself, as said negation would have

288
0:19:08,160 --> 0:19:12,080
to be performed by a living man who chooses to keep living for the purpose of uttering his negation.

289
0:19:12,080 --> 0:19:16,320
The good, therefore, corresponds to that which is pro-life, and the bad, that which is anti-life.

290
0:19:16,320 --> 0:19:20,320
Furthermore, man is not an automaton. He evaluates because he chooses. The choice he has at any

291
0:19:20,320 --> 0:19:24,640
crossroads is whether to be pro-life, i.e. in correspondence to reality, or anti-life, i.e.

292
0:19:24,640 --> 0:19:28,640
not in correspondence to reality. In other words, a man always has the choice whether to accept truth,

293
0:19:28,640 --> 0:19:33,200
to think, or to reject truth, to evade it. Because evading reality is itself a rejection of truth,

294
0:19:33,200 --> 0:19:37,280
one cannot coherently argue for evasion, as this would involve making the truth claim that there

295
0:19:37,280 --> 0:19:42,160
is no such thing as truth, to which all one can ask, is it true that there is no such thing as truth?

296
0:19:42,160 --> 0:19:47,120
Because evasion or pro-falsehood is anti-life, and life is undeniably good, evasion is undeniably

297
0:19:47,120 --> 0:19:51,360
bad. In other words, any is statement implies a set of ought statements, and vice versa.

298
0:19:51,360 --> 0:19:55,120
Making a moral claim implies presuppositions about epistemology and metaphysics, and making

299
0:19:55,120 --> 0:19:58,800
claims about epistemology and metaphysics necessarily implies certain things about ethics.

300
0:19:58,800 --> 0:20:02,160
QUOTE In the objective approach, since every fact bears them the choice to live, every truth

301
0:20:02,160 --> 0:20:06,400
necessarily entails a value judgment, and every value judgment necessarily presupposes a truth.

302
0:20:06,400 --> 0:20:10,640
As Ayn Rand states the point in the objectivist ethics, knowledge for any conscious organism

303
0:20:10,640 --> 0:20:14,240
is the means for survival. To live in consciousness, every is implies an ought.

304
0:20:14,240 --> 0:20:17,040
Evaluation, accordingly, is not a compartmentalized function,

305
0:20:17,040 --> 0:20:20,160
applicable only to some aspect of a man's life or of reality.

306
0:20:20,160 --> 0:20:23,760
END QUOTE If one chooses to live, and to be objective, a process of evaluation is co-extensive with,

307
0:20:23,760 --> 0:20:27,920
That is, facts about reality, such as that the sun shines or that lightning strikes,

308
0:20:27,920 --> 0:20:31,680
have implications for man's self-preservation, and because man

309
0:20:31,680 --> 0:20:35,520
objectively ought endeavour to preserve himself, these metaphysically given facts implies certain

310
0:20:35,520 --> 0:20:38,960
things about what man should be doing. The fact that the sun shines and that within certain limits,

311
0:20:38,960 --> 0:20:43,120
sunshine is good for man, implies all sorts of oughts. For instance, other things being equal,

312
0:20:43,120 --> 0:20:46,160
we ought grow our crops in the shine rather than the shade, because doing so will yield

313
0:20:46,160 --> 0:20:49,840
more crops, and thus further man's life more than the alternative. Also, we ought build our

314
0:20:49,840 --> 0:20:53,440
houses such that they have windows and we can get vitamin D, but sunlight can also cause us damage

315
0:20:53,440 --> 0:20:56,640
by burning our skin if we get too much of it, so other things being equal, we ought avoid

316
0:20:56,640 --> 0:21:00,160
this outcome, possibly wearing sunscreen or bringing an umbrella for shade. All these

317
0:21:00,160 --> 0:21:04,080
evaluations are demanded by the cognitions involved. Again, because these things are pro-life,

318
0:21:04,080 --> 0:21:08,320
they are pro-truth and reality, therefore these oughts cannot be coherently negated. Moreover,

319
0:21:08,320 --> 0:21:11,920
to attempt to negate such an ought is indicative of an error in the thinker in question. They are

320
0:21:11,920 --> 0:21:15,520
either making an honest mistake or they are on an active rebellion against truth. Because error

321
0:21:15,520 --> 0:21:19,600
is bad, to embrace an error as fully as does the thinker an active rebellion against truth, implies

322
0:21:19,600 --> 0:21:23,440
that the proper moral evaluation of this thinker is that he is wicked. Now, this is not the case

323
0:21:23,440 --> 0:21:27,600
for all such instances of perpetuating of falsehood. Men are capable of making honest

324
0:21:27,600 --> 0:21:30,960
mistakes in their understanding of reality. This is most prevalent in the very young or

325
0:21:30,960 --> 0:21:34,880
the intellectually impaired. This is quite distinct to the academic Marxists and other subjectivists who

326
0:21:34,880 --> 0:21:38,400
dedicate their lives to the perpetuation of intellectually dishonest ideas.

327
0:21:38,400 --> 0:21:42,000
QUOTE conscious attempt to perceive reality by the use of one's mind is the essence of honesty,

328
0:21:42,000 --> 0:21:45,600
no such rebellion could qualify as honest. The originators, leaders, and intellectual

329
0:21:45,600 --> 0:21:49,280
spokesman of all such movements are necessarily evaders on a major scale. They are not merely

330
0:21:49,280 --> 0:21:52,960
mistaken, but are crusading irrationalists. The mass base of such movements are not

331
0:21:52,960 --> 0:21:56,720
evaders of the same kind, but most of the followers are dishonest in their own passive way. They

332
0:21:56,720 --> 0:22:00,320
are unthinking intellectually irresponsible, ballast, unconcerned with logic or truth.

333
0:22:00,320 --> 0:22:04,080
They go along with corrupt trendsetters because their neighbours demand it, and or because

334
0:22:04,080 --> 0:22:08,000
a given notion satisfies some out-of-context desire they happen to feel. People of this kind

335
0:22:08,000 --> 0:22:12,160
are not the helplessly ignorant, but the wheelfully self-deluded. Even in regard to inherently

336
0:22:12,160 --> 0:22:16,240
dishonest movements, let me now add, a marginal third category of adherence as possible.

337
0:22:16,240 --> 0:22:19,440
There are a relatively small number whose struggle haunts you anxiously, but simply

338
0:22:19,440 --> 0:22:23,680
cannot grasp the issues and monument or corruption involved. These are a handful of became communists,

339
0:22:23,680 --> 0:22:27,760
channelers, etc., through a truly honest error of knowledge, leaving aside the retarded and

340
0:22:27,760 --> 0:22:32,080
illiterate who are effectively helpless in such matters. This third group consists almost exclusively

341
0:22:32,080 --> 0:22:36,080
of the very young, and precisely for this reason, these youngsters get out of such movements fast,

342
0:22:36,080 --> 0:22:39,680
on their own, without needing lectures from others. They get out of the rich maturity.

343
0:22:39,680 --> 0:22:43,600
Being conscientious and mentally active, they see first-hand what is going on in the movement

344
0:22:43,600 --> 0:22:47,760
and identify what it means, so their initial enthusiasm turns to dismay and then to our,

345
0:22:47,760 --> 0:22:51,680
andray and we the living may be taken as a fictional symbol here. The very honesty of such

346
0:22:51,680 --> 0:22:55,360
individuals limits their stay in the movement. They can't tolerate for long the massiveness

347
0:22:55,360 --> 0:22:59,120
of the evil with which they have become involved, nor when such youngsters drop out. They say to

348
0:22:59,120 --> 0:23:02,880
the world, belligerently, don't dare judge me from my past, because my error was honest.

349
0:23:02,880 --> 0:23:06,240
On the contrary, and here I speak from my own personal experience of honest errors that I

350
0:23:06,240 --> 0:23:09,760
commit to as a teenager, the best among these young people are contrite. They recognise

351
0:23:09,760 --> 0:23:13,760
aid and comfort, inadvertent though it be, which they've been given to error and evil, and they seek

352
0:23:13,760 --> 0:23:17,200
to make amends for it. They expect those who know of their past creates and allegiances to

353
0:23:17,200 --> 0:23:21,440
regard to a suspicion. They know that it is their own responsibility to demonstrate objectively and

354
0:23:21,440 --> 0:23:24,560
END QUOTE across time that they have changed, that they will not repeat their error tomorrow in another

355
0:23:24,560 --> 0:23:28,720
Any form of ethical subjectivism, which is required for the fact-value dichotomy to stand,

356
0:23:28,720 --> 0:23:32,240
implies an epistemology that holds that mere whims are the proper source of evaluation.

357
0:23:32,240 --> 0:23:36,240
This would make ethics, and therefore a law, a completely pointless field

358
0:23:36,240 --> 0:23:40,000
with no reason for existing. That is to say, reacting to Hume's guillotine implies the complete

359
0:23:40,000 --> 0:23:43,440
destruction of ethics to the chattering applause of the most evil philosophies known to man. But

360
0:23:43,440 --> 0:23:47,280
as Hoppe points out, there are certain norms, namely property rights, that must be accepted as

361
0:23:47,280 --> 0:23:51,360
valid prior to beginning any ethical deliberation whatsoever, even an ethical deliberation that seeks

362
0:23:51,360 --> 0:23:56,000
to destroy ethics. Therefore, any ethical theorist who attempts to erect a dichotomy between fact

363
0:23:56,000 --> 0:24:00,240
and value must accept as valid certain values whilst attempting to demonstrate the invalidity of

364
0:24:00,240 --> 0:24:04,320
value as such. So a philosopher qua ethical theorist cannot speak of Hume's guillotine

365
0:24:04,320 --> 0:24:08,480
without falling into utter incoherence, and thus ethical subjectivism is an incoherent

366
0:24:08,480 --> 0:24:12,400
anti-ethics. The immorality of error in one's understanding of the metaphysically given,

367
0:24:12,400 --> 0:24:16,160
such as that the sun shines, or that gravity causes objects fall, pales in comparison to the

368
0:24:16,160 --> 0:24:20,080
immorality present whenever there are errors in man-made facts, consider a world of total

369
0:24:20,080 --> 0:24:24,000
unreason in philosophy. Such a world would imply mass death and suffering of the worst kinds,

370
0:24:24,000 --> 0:24:28,240
as all men would be acting as did Mao and Hitler and Stalin. No matter the level of technological

371
0:24:28,240 --> 0:24:31,920
development, such as society would be incapable of supporting human life. On the contrary,

372
0:24:31,920 --> 0:24:36,080
a far more technologically primitive society, that accepts entirely reason and objective reality,

373
0:24:36,080 --> 0:24:39,920
would find barely any natural disaster that could not be withstood. The standard of living

374
0:24:39,920 --> 0:24:43,600
in such society would quickly soar, where the opposite is true of the irrational society.

375
0:24:43,600 --> 0:24:46,880
QUOTE To an individual and divisional labour society, it makes it a way for death different, whether

376
0:24:46,880 --> 0:24:50,640
he's surrounded by producers or parasites, honest men or cheats, independent men or power

377
0:24:50,640 --> 0:24:54,160
lustres. Just as one must distinguish being good and bad in relation to the realm of nature,

378
0:24:54,160 --> 0:24:57,200
so one must distinguish being good and bad in relation to the realm of man.

379
0:24:57,200 --> 0:25:01,280
In objective terms, this means a single fundamental issue. In the human realm, one must distinguish

380
0:25:01,280 --> 0:25:05,280
the rational from the irrational. The thinker is from the aviators, such a judgment tells one

381
0:25:05,280 --> 0:25:08,960
whether a man, in principle, is committed to reality, or to escaping from and fighting it.

382
0:25:08,960 --> 0:25:12,880
In one case, he's an ally and potential benefactor of the living, in the other, an enemy and potential

383
0:25:12,880 --> 0:25:17,840
destroyer, thus the mandate of justice. Identify the good, the rational, and the evil, the irrational,

384
0:25:17,840 --> 0:25:23,520
END QUOTE in men and their works. Then first, deal with, support, and or reward the good. And second,

385
0:25:23,520 --> 0:25:27,200
So the proper moral evaluation of an idea, or more broadly a philosophy,

386
0:25:27,200 --> 0:25:30,640
is that it's good insofar as it promotes human flourishing.

387
0:25:30,640 --> 0:25:34,400
And bad, insofar as it does the opposite. This evaluation is not based on an arbitrary whim

388
0:25:34,400 --> 0:25:37,680
of the evaluator. It is not the claim that the idea or philosophy in question is merely

389
0:25:37,680 --> 0:25:41,520
distasteful to the man making the evaluation. An objective evaluation must make reference

390
0:25:41,520 --> 0:25:45,680
to the objective and undeniable value of life itself.

391
0:25:45,680 --> 0:25:48,560
QUOTE is a positive moral estimate of the mental processes that led to it,

392
0:25:48,560 --> 0:25:52,080
a credit to the individual for having worked to grasp reality, and a positive estimate of the

393
0:25:52,080 --> 0:25:56,640
existential results to come. A true idea will have to yield poor life results when men act on it,

394
0:25:56,640 --> 0:26:01,200
the same applies mutatus butanis to false ideas. Implicit in seeing that an idea contradicts the

395
0:26:01,200 --> 0:26:05,200
facts of reality, is a negative estimate of the processes that led to it, and also of the effects

396
0:26:05,200 --> 0:26:09,440
that the idea will have in practice, which have to be to harmful. If one's ideas are tied to reality

397
0:26:09,440 --> 0:26:13,840
at all, and if one is guided by life as a standard, there is no way to identify an idea's truth or

398
0:26:13,840 --> 0:26:18,160
falsehood without it in some form also making such evaluations. Truth is a product of effort,

399
0:26:18,160 --> 0:26:22,400
and leads to inaction to values. Hence, when it says the idea is not only true, it is also good.

400
0:26:22,400 --> 0:26:26,000
Faucet, assuming it reaches a certain scale, is a product of evasion, and leads to destruction.

401
0:26:26,000 --> 0:26:29,760
Such an idea is not only false, it is also evil. An employee, to take a relatively modest

402
0:26:29,760 --> 0:26:33,520
positive example, offers a man an idea for improving the operation of his business.

403
0:26:33,520 --> 0:26:36,960
His idea, thus concludes after weighing the evidence, takes into account all the relevant

404
0:26:36,960 --> 0:26:41,120
facts. He's right, so far this is a pure cognition, the outcome of which is expressed in a statement

405
0:26:41,120 --> 0:26:45,040
like, I agree with you. When a decent person, whether he knew his philosophy or not, would stop there,

406
0:26:45,040 --> 0:26:49,440
he would not say unemotionally like a dead fish, your idea is correct, good day. On the contrary,

407
0:26:49,440 --> 0:26:53,200
precisely because the new idea represents a new grasp of reality, the moral kind of boss is

408
0:26:53,200 --> 0:26:57,680
enthusiastic, he evaluates the idea, he can't avoid seeing two things, this employee of mine had

409
0:26:57,680 --> 0:27:01,760
to innovate, struggle, think, to reach the idea when no one else did, and the idea will cut my

410
0:27:01,760 --> 0:27:05,920
costs, increase my customers, double my profits. The boss accordingly is excited, he likes the

411
0:27:05,920 --> 0:27:10,720
employee, he praises him, he rewards him, he not only says about the idea, true, as an inevitable

412
0:27:10,720 --> 0:27:15,920
END QUOTE corollary, he says about it, good, that good is the evaluation or the ought, he represents the

413
0:27:15,920 --> 0:27:19,760
Thus it is completely inescapable that true is-statements

414
0:27:19,760 --> 0:27:23,920
imply true evaluations related to those statements, and false is-statements imply

415
0:27:23,920 --> 0:27:28,080
false evaluations related to those statements, just as it is an error for the primitive man to

416
0:27:28,080 --> 0:27:31,920
attempt to make it rain by dancing, it is an error to commit murder or steal a wallet,

417
0:27:31,920 --> 0:27:34,800
these actions are bad because they are destructive of life and human flourishing,

418
0:27:34,800 --> 0:27:37,920
it is impossible to construct a rational property norm where aggression is allowed,

419
0:27:37,920 --> 0:27:41,680
and just as the fact that the rain dancer is acting an error is not negated by the fact that he is

420
0:27:41,680 --> 0:27:45,680
still capable of performing the rain dance, nor is the fact that the murderer is acting in error

421
0:27:45,680 --> 0:27:49,040
negated by the fact that he is still capable of murder, it is incoherent to claim any crime to

422
0:27:49,040 --> 0:27:53,200
be a moral virtue, as every crime implies an evasion of objective law, and evasions are

423
0:27:53,200 --> 0:28:08,480
per se errors and errors are per se immoral, the true is the good, and the good is the true.
