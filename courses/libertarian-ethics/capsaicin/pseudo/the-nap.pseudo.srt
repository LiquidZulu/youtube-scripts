0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:17,600
2. The non-aggression principle

2
0:00:17,600 --> 0:00:21,600
Corconition and truth seeking as such have a value normative foundation, and the normative

3
0:00:21,600 --> 0:00:25,560
foundation on which cognition and truth rest is the recognition of private property rights

4
0:00:25,560 --> 0:00:30,960
In the previous lesson we discovered some necessary facts about the nature of law,

5
0:00:30,960 --> 0:00:35,520
We know that there must be a universal objective law, and we know that

6
0:00:35,520 --> 0:00:39,920
the normative structure of law must be based upon the normative structure of argumentation.

7
0:00:39,920 --> 0:00:44,680
In this lesson, the central norm, the core axiom of true law, will be made explicit.

8
0:00:44,680 --> 0:00:49,040
We call this central axiom the non-aggression principle, or NAP, and it can be stated

9
0:00:49,040 --> 0:00:53,320
as follows. The non-aggressor ought be the director, or that the aggressor ought not

10
0:00:53,320 --> 0:00:58,120
be the director. These statements are contrapositive. Let's break that down. Here, aggression

11
0:00:58,120 --> 0:01:02,920
is defined as the initiation of conflict, so in any contest over some property alpha,

12
0:01:02,920 --> 0:01:06,880
if A is the aggressor and B is the non-aggressor, B ought to be the one to direct the use of

13
0:01:06,880 --> 0:01:12,040
alpha and A ought not. The term axiom has a precise meaning in philosophy. Unlike in mathematics

14
0:01:12,040 --> 0:01:16,800
where axioms are merely inter-consistent but arbitrarily chosen rules, praxeological axioms

15
0:01:16,800 --> 0:01:21,320
are self-evident propositions. A proposition is self-evident if you must accept its validity

16
0:01:21,320 --> 0:01:24,920
in attempting to dispute its validity. We saw above how the law of non-contradiction

17
0:01:24,920 --> 0:01:28,560
is a self-evident proposition. In disputing anything at all, you must first accept that

18
0:01:28,560 --> 0:01:33,560
the law of non-contradiction holds. Similarly, in disputing the NAP, you presuppose its truth,

19
0:01:33,560 --> 0:01:37,800
as it is implied by the very nature of argumentation. First, recall that argumentation does not

20
0:01:37,800 --> 0:01:41,480
exist in a normative void. That is to say, there are certain norms which are presupposed

21
0:01:41,480 --> 0:01:45,040
in the very act of arguing. Consider what it would mean for this to not be the case.

22
0:01:45,040 --> 0:01:48,920
If argumentation had no particular normative structure, it would lose any meaning. Literally

23
0:01:48,920 --> 0:01:52,560
any action a man takes could be considered an argumentation, such as eating an apple

24
0:01:52,560 --> 0:01:55,720
or swinging from a tree, or shooting someone through the head. It is because of

25
0:01:55,720 --> 0:02:00,160
the fact that certain norms define a dialectic as such, there is such a thing called argumentation

26
0:02:00,160 --> 0:02:04,240
in the first place. Second, the validity of any truth claim must be raised and decided

27
0:02:04,240 --> 0:02:07,840
upon in the course of an argumentation, so the normative structure of argumentation in

28
0:02:07,840 --> 0:02:11,280
particular has a special status being the practical precondition for ascertaining

29
0:02:11,280 --> 0:02:15,600
the truth or validity of any statement. This is known as the a priori of argumentation,

30
0:02:15,600 --> 0:02:19,120
which is another self-evident proposition. If you were to dispute it, you would first

31
0:02:19,120 --> 0:02:23,320
have to start arguing, thus presupposing its truth. Third, to try and argumentatively

32
0:02:23,320 --> 0:02:27,200
dispute one of the norms of argumentation would be to contradict oneself. This is called

33
0:02:27,200 --> 0:02:31,200
a dialectic or a performative contradiction. That is, it is a contradiction not between

34
0:02:31,200 --> 0:02:35,160
propositions but between a proposition and the very act of proposing it. For instance,

35
0:02:35,160 --> 0:02:38,400
if one were to argue that people ought never argue, they would first presuppose that they

36
0:02:38,400 --> 0:02:42,680
should be arguing, thus they are in contradiction. Therefore, the negation of people ought never

37
0:02:42,680 --> 0:02:47,760
argue, which is people ought ever argue, or people ought sometimes argue, must be correct.

38
0:02:47,760 --> 0:02:51,920
Of note here is that under argumentation ethics, the "sometimes" is not an arbitrary when I feel

39
0:02:51,920 --> 0:02:55,880
like it. It is something more like people should argue to resolve disputes, rather than

40
0:02:55,880 --> 0:03:00,160
people should engage in conflict to resolve disputes. This is because, fourth, argumentation

41
0:03:00,160 --> 0:03:04,520
is a conflict-free interaction. Interlocutors have some dispute over the truth of the matter,

42
0:03:04,520 --> 0:03:07,560
and they are seeking to convince the other, not through the force of violence, i.e., by

43
0:03:07,560 --> 0:03:11,840
aggressing against them, but rather through the force of their argument. Specifically,

44
0:03:11,840 --> 0:03:16,400
argumentation is a method of resolving disputes peacefully, not violently. Consider A and B have a dispute

45
0:03:16,400 --> 0:03:19,840
over who has the property right to Alpha. A asserts that they are the owner, and vice

46
0:03:19,840 --> 0:03:24,080
versa. Arguing over this dispute would not involve the two parties violently attacking

47
0:03:24,080 --> 0:03:27,560
each other. It would involve the exchange of propositions with the intent of determining

48
0:03:27,560 --> 0:03:32,200
the truth of the matter. Simply warring over Alpha would not be truth-seeking. Interpersonal

49
0:03:32,200 --> 0:03:36,440
warfare does not involve argumentative justification, and argumentative justification does not involve

50
0:03:36,440 --> 0:03:40,440
interpersonal warfare. This means that the normative structure of argumentation implies

51
0:03:40,440 --> 0:03:44,720
non-aggression. Thus, the NAP is dialectically true. Consider what it would mean to say

52
0:03:44,720 --> 0:03:48,320
that this is not the case, that violence is perfectly permissible in an argument.

53
0:03:48,320 --> 0:03:51,280
If Crusoe has a disagreement with Friday, and Crusoe decides that he will beat Friday

54
0:03:51,280 --> 0:03:55,360
until agreement is reached, is Crusoe really seeking the truth of the matter here? Clearly

55
0:03:55,360 --> 0:04:00,080
he is not. Coercing others to not argue with you cannot tend to establish truth. Warfare

56
0:04:00,080 --> 0:04:04,720
of this sort is the enemy of reason. Insofar as a man is engaged in unreason, i.e., avoiding

57
0:04:04,720 --> 0:04:09,000
truth, he cannot coherently make any truth claim. Thus, no negation of any proposition

58
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,440
can arise from unreason. You have to accept reason, in order to argue at all, and accepting

59
0:04:13,440 --> 0:04:17,640
reason means accepting the NAP. It certainly cannot be denied that the purpose of argumentation

60
0:04:17,640 --> 0:04:22,120
is to seek truth on the matter. So such aggressive activities that do not tend to establish truth

61
0:04:22,120 --> 0:04:26,720
must be excluded from arguments. In short, argumentation is a rational activity, and

62
0:04:26,720 --> 0:04:31,400
aggression is the enemy of reason. Thus, these sets of actions must be mutually exclusive.

63
0:04:31,400 --> 0:04:36,560
All true propositions are justifiable argumentatively. A true ethic is justifiable to an arguer.

64
0:04:36,560 --> 0:04:40,920
Justifiability is irrelevant in a conflict. A conflict cannot be justified to an arguer.

65
0:04:40,920 --> 0:04:45,280
If it could, there will be no conflict. Hence, causing conflicts is against the ethics of argumentation.

66
0:04:45,280 --> 0:04:49,320
QUOTE Looked at from another angle, participants in argumentation indisputably

67
0:04:49,320 --> 0:04:53,400
need to use and control the scarce resources in the world to survive. Otherwise, they

68
0:04:53,400 --> 0:04:57,640
would perish. But because their scarcity makes conflict over the use of resource as possible,

69
0:04:57,640 --> 0:05:01,560
only norms that determine the proper ownership can avoid conflict over these scarce goods.

70
0:05:01,560 --> 0:05:05,040
That such norms are valuable cannot be denied, because anyone who is alive in the world on

71
0:05:05,040 --> 0:05:08,440
participating in the practical activity of argumentation cannot deny the value of being

72
0:05:08,440 --> 0:05:13,000
END QUOTE able to control scarce resources and the value of avoiding conflicts over such scarce resources.

73
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,960
A further proof of the existence of rights is found by considering what it would mean

74
0:05:15,960 --> 0:05:20,560
to deny that rights exist. Kinsella introduces the concept as follows:

75
0:05:20,560 --> 0:05:25,280
END QUOTE exists, it is a right of A to have or do X without B's preventing it, and therefore

76
0:05:25,280 --> 0:05:29,160
A can legitimately use force against B to enforce the right. A is concerned with the

77
0:05:29,160 --> 0:05:33,040
enforceability of his right to X, and this enforceability is all that A requires in order

78
0:05:33,040 --> 0:05:36,760
to be secure in his right to X. For a right skeptic, meaningfully, to a challenge A is

79
0:05:36,760 --> 0:05:40,720
asserted right, the skeptic must challenge the enforceability of the right, instead of

80
0:05:40,720 --> 0:05:44,480
merely challenging the existence of the right. Nothing less will do. If the skeptic does

81
0:05:44,480 --> 0:05:48,240
not deny that A's post-enforcement of his purported right is legitimate, then the skeptic

82
0:05:48,240 --> 0:05:51,920
has not denied A's right to X, because what it means to have a right is to be able to

83
0:05:51,920 --> 0:05:56,840
legitimately enforce it. If the skeptic maintains then that A has no right to X, indeed no rights

84
0:05:56,840 --> 0:06:00,520
END QUOTE at all since there are no rights, the skeptic must also maintain that A's enforcement of

85
0:06:00,520 --> 0:06:04,520
This presents a problem for the rights-sceptic, however,

86
0:06:04,520 --> 0:06:08,640
because he must hold that enforcement, i.e. the use of force, requires justification,

87
0:06:08,640 --> 0:06:12,520
but merely challenging A's use of force is not enough. The rights-sceptic can't just

88
0:06:12,520 --> 0:06:17,080
express distaste at the enforcement, he must attack the legitimacy of said use of force.

89
0:06:17,080 --> 0:06:20,920
But in order to challenge the legitimacy of A using force against B to enforce the right,

90
0:06:20,920 --> 0:06:24,840
he must hold that B has a right to not have this force against him, i.e. that B or someone

91
0:06:24,840 --> 0:06:29,560
else can legitimately use force to stop A's use of force, but then he is in contradiction,

92
0:06:29,560 --> 0:06:34,360
as he must recognize rights held by B in his denial that rights exist.

93
0:06:34,360 --> 0:06:37,640
QUOTE this demonstration points out the inconsistency on the part of a right skeptic who engages

94
0:06:37,640 --> 0:06:41,120
in discourse about the propriety of rights at all. If there are no rights, then there's

95
0:06:41,120 --> 0:06:44,880
no such thing as the justifiable or legitimate use of force, but neither is there such a

96
0:06:44,880 --> 0:06:49,400
thing as the unjust use of force. But if there is no unjust use of force, what is it exactly

97
0:06:49,400 --> 0:06:52,960
that a right skeptic is concerned about? If individuals delude themselves into thinking

98
0:06:52,960 --> 0:06:56,640
that they have natural rights and acting on this assumption go by enforcing these rights

99
0:06:56,640 --> 0:07:00,160
as if they are true, the skeptic has no grounds to complain. To the extent that the skeptic

100
0:07:00,160 --> 0:07:03,800
complains about people enforcing these illusory rights, he begins to attribute rights to those

101
0:07:03,800 --> 0:07:08,280
having forces against them. Any right skeptic can only shut up, because he contradicts himself

102
0:07:08,280 --> 0:07:11,680
the moment he objects to others acting as if they have rights. Indeed, another way to

103
0:07:11,680 --> 0:07:15,480
respond to a right skeptic would be to propose to physically harm him. If there are no rights

104
0:07:15,480 --> 0:07:19,440
as he maintains, then he cannot object to being harmed. So presumably any right skeptic would

105
0:07:19,440 --> 0:07:23,240
change his position and admit that there were rights, if only so as to be able to object

106
0:07:23,240 --> 0:07:27,120
END QUOTE to being harmed, or there would soon be no more right skeptics left alive to give rights

107
0:07:27,120 --> 0:07:31,240
A somewhat common question raised with respect to the non-aggression

108
0:07:31,240 --> 0:07:35,120
principle is whether the mob boss who merely orders his goons to engage in some aggression

109
0:07:35,120 --> 0:07:39,360
is himself an aggressor. The answer to this question is yes. Both he and his goons are

110
0:07:39,360 --> 0:07:42,720
engaged in the aggression in question. To highlight why this is the case, consider that

111
0:07:42,720 --> 0:07:46,400
a crime is an action. It is the use of efficacious means to cause the invasion of the borders

112
0:07:46,400 --> 0:07:49,760
of other people's property. Because such an invasion initiates conflict between the

113
0:07:49,760 --> 0:07:53,160
criminal and the victim. What is important here is that you can use other people as means

114
0:07:53,160 --> 0:07:56,960
towards some end. In the provided example, the mob boss is using his goons as a means

115
0:07:56,960 --> 0:08:00,480
to cause the invasion of the victim's property, and the goons are using their hands or some

116
0:08:00,480 --> 0:08:04,400
weapons as a means to the same end. Both the boss and his goons are engaged in the same

117
0:08:04,400 --> 0:08:07,960
aggressive invasion. Consider the example of a man shipping a bomb to a victim's house

118
0:08:07,960 --> 0:08:11,840
using a courier. The bomb blows up upon the victim opening the package. Has the bomb maker

119
0:08:11,840 --> 0:08:15,880
committed a crime here? Well, if using other people as means is to break the chain of causation,

120
0:08:15,880 --> 0:08:18,920
then perhaps the courier is the criminal, as he is the one who delivered the bomb. But

121
0:08:18,920 --> 0:08:22,840
even this cannot be so, because the bomb only went off upon the victim opening the package.

122
0:08:22,840 --> 0:08:26,800
So really, the victim has committed suicide! Of course, this is ridiculous. The bomb maker

123
0:08:26,800 --> 0:08:30,440
is well aware that paying a courier to deliver a package to someone is likely to result in

124
0:08:30,440 --> 0:08:34,200
said package being opened. The courier and the victim are both being used as a means

125
0:08:34,200 --> 0:08:38,280
towards the end of the victim exploding. This is the intent of the bomb maker.

126
0:08:38,280 --> 0:08:42,000
QUOTE positive law recognised that an intervening force only breaks the causal connection when

127
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:46,000
it is unforeseeable. As the restatement of Torz provides, the intervention of a force

128
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:50,600
which is a normal consequence of a situation created by the actor's conduct is not a superseding

129
0:08:50,600 --> 0:08:55,360
cause of harm, which such conduct has been a substantial factor in bringing about. Clearly,

130
0:08:55,360 --> 0:08:59,560
when the terrorist in these cases uses a courier to deliver a later bomb, it is not unforeseeable

131
0:08:59,560 --> 0:09:02,960
END QUOTE that the victim will receive it, and it is not unforeseeable that the victim will open

132
0:09:02,960 --> 0:09:07,000
This is because, if the outcome of a given activity was truly unforeseeable, this implies

133
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,080
it is not an action. As for it to be an action, it has to be deliberately aimed at and sought

134
0:09:11,080 --> 0:09:14,880
after. Consider me leaving a knife on my kitchen counter that is then whipped away by a tornado

135
0:09:14,880 --> 0:09:18,720
and thus stabs a man through the heart. I didn't stab him, the tornado did, because

136
0:09:18,720 --> 0:09:22,720
the tornado was unforeseeable by me. If I was a wizard, who could control tornadoes and

137
0:09:22,720 --> 0:09:26,720
I summoned the tornado to throw my knife into the heart of the man, that would be foreseeable

138
0:09:26,720 --> 0:09:31,320
and therefore criminal. In other words, A simply hoping that lightning will strike B is different

139
0:09:31,320 --> 0:09:35,200
to A knowing exactly when and where lightning will strike and duping B into standing there at the appropriate time.

140
0:09:35,200 --> 0:09:39,720
There is no intention if the outcome is only hoped for.

141
0:09:39,720 --> 0:09:43,480
To make this even more clear, consider the example of a rifle that requires 3 men to shoot, perhaps

142
0:09:43,480 --> 0:09:47,200
it has 3 triggers which are far apart on which all must be pulled to fire the bullet. If

143
0:09:47,200 --> 0:09:51,200
3 men conspire to each pull a trigger, at the same time to shoot an innocent man, then

144
0:09:51,200 --> 0:09:54,600
all 3 of them are engaged in an aggression against this person. We can trivially

145
0:09:54,600 --> 0:09:58,680
analogise this to a bomber plane that requires 3 men to operate. One to steer the plane,

146
0:09:58,680 --> 0:10:02,440
one to load the bombs, and a third to trigger the release of the bombs. It is not only the

147
0:10:02,440 --> 0:10:06,480
man who triggers the release, but also his two co-conspirators, who are each engaged in the

148
0:10:06,480 --> 0:10:10,320
action of bombing with the bomber plane. Insofar as this bombing is an aggression,

149
0:10:10,320 --> 0:10:14,160
all 3 men are equally liable for this crime. This is why the getaway driver in a bank

150
0:10:14,160 --> 0:10:17,880
robbery is just as liable for the theft as his partners who restrained the crowd and stole

151
0:10:17,880 --> 0:10:21,960
the funds from the vault respectively. Furthermore, if in the process of the robbery, the crowd

152
0:10:21,960 --> 0:10:25,840
controller shoots one of the hostages, the getaway driver and the safe cracker are responsible

153
0:10:25,840 --> 0:10:29,320
for this murder, because the murder is understood to be a part of the entire robbery going

154
0:10:29,320 --> 0:10:32,720
forth. If instead they were not robbing a bank, which involves threatening hostages

155
0:10:32,720 --> 0:10:36,440
with death, but rather jointly attempting to steal a car, then one of the car thieves

156
0:10:36,440 --> 0:10:41,160
randomly sets off a bomb killing countless individuals, then only the bomber is responsible.

157
0:10:41,160 --> 0:10:44,800
Setting off the bomb is a separate action to the stealing of the cars, so the co-conspirators

158
0:10:44,800 --> 0:10:48,880
to the car theft are not responsible for it. To reiterate this point, allow me to quote Kinsella.

159
0:10:48,880 --> 0:10:53,000
QUOTE Consider the following example, and our content, A, purchases a remote controlled

160
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,800
tank, with a remote control he can steer the tank and fire its cannon. He directs the tank

161
0:10:56,800 --> 0:10:59,760
to blow down the walls of his neighbour's house, destroying the house and killing the

162
0:10:59,760 --> 0:11:03,000
neighbour. No one would deny that A is the cause of the killing and is guilty of murder

163
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:07,140
and trespass. However, after the rampage, a hatch opens up in the tank and an evil midget

164
0:11:07,140 --> 0:11:10,480
jumps out. It turns out, you see, that the midget could see on the screen which buttons

165
0:11:10,480 --> 0:11:14,320
were pressed on the remote control, and he would operate the tank accordingly. We submit

166
0:11:14,320 --> 0:11:18,680
that A is equally liable in both cases. From his point of view, the tank was a black box

167
0:11:18,680 --> 0:11:22,160
END QUOTE that he used to attain his end. Regardless of whether there is a human will, somewhere

168
0:11:22,160 --> 0:11:26,360
This black box thinking is crucial;

169
0:11:26,360 --> 0:11:29,920
consider what would happen if it was discovered someday that firearms

170
0:11:29,920 --> 0:11:33,760
are actually sentient and capable of choosing not to accept a trigger press, and that this

171
0:11:33,760 --> 0:11:37,680
is the cause of bullet jams. Would this suddenly absolve everyone who has used a firearm to

172
0:11:37,680 --> 0:11:42,080
kill another of any criminal responsibility? Surely not. None of these people knew that

173
0:11:42,080 --> 0:11:46,200
firearms were sentient and could refuse to shoot. To the gunman, the firearm is a means

174
0:11:46,200 --> 0:11:49,920
towards the end of shooting a bullet at their victim. This does not change if it is later

175
0:11:49,920 --> 0:11:53,440
discovered that firearms have a mind of their own.

176
0:11:53,440 --> 0:11:57,280
QUOTE means it is illegal to cause another person to be hit. That is to say, it is illegal to

177
0:11:57,280 --> 0:12:01,240
use physical objects, including one's fist, in a way that will cause the unwanted physical

178
0:12:01,240 --> 0:12:05,480
contact with another person. In analyzing actions through the lens of praxiological means and

179
0:12:05,480 --> 0:12:09,600
structure to determine if it amounts to aggression, we ask if the actor employed means to achieve

180
0:12:09,600 --> 0:12:13,840
the end of invading the borders of another's property or body. In other words, we ask

181
0:12:13,840 --> 0:12:18,760
if he caused the border invasion. The means employed can be inanimate or nonhuman means,

182
0:12:18,760 --> 0:12:22,680
governed solely by causal laws, agan, or it can include other humans who are employed

183
0:12:22,680 --> 0:12:26,600
as means to achieve the illicit end desire. The latter category includes both innocent

184
0:12:26,600 --> 0:12:31,640
END QUOTE humans that one employs to cause a border invasion and culpable humans that one conspires, co-operates

185
0:12:31,640 --> 0:12:35,960
We can use this analysis to highlight the guilt of Henry II of England,

186
0:12:35,960 --> 0:12:40,440
who reportedly exclaimed, "will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?"

187
0:12:40,440 --> 0:12:44,000
to a group of knights under his employ. The turbulent priest referred to the Archbishop

188
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:48,080
of Canterbury, who had excommunicated a number of bishops supportive of the king. Four of

189
0:12:48,080 --> 0:12:51,600
the king's knights upon hearing the king's utterance went to the Archbishop and murdered

190
0:12:51,600 --> 0:12:54,040
him. The argument is that the king's words, though

191
0:12:54,040 --> 0:12:57,920
not literally worded as an order, nevertheless communicated to his knights that he wished

192
0:12:57,920 --> 0:13:01,200
for them to carry out the ridding of the priest. What this highlights is the importance of

193
0:13:01,200 --> 0:13:05,080
communication in libertarian theory. The king is using his knights that he means because

194
0:13:05,080 --> 0:13:09,320
he is communicating to them his desire for them to kill or otherwise coerce the priest.

195
0:13:09,320 --> 0:13:12,640
What this shows is that social norms and understanding of language can influence whether

196
0:13:12,640 --> 0:13:16,600
a given set of words demonstrate an aggression or not. So it may be the case that if I'm

197
0:13:16,600 --> 0:13:20,080
in a seedy bar and I go up to the biggest, toughest guy in there and call his mother a whore,

198
0:13:20,080 --> 0:13:23,560
I am in fact communicating to him that I want a fight. Or another case is when I have a

199
0:13:23,560 --> 0:13:27,000
mailbox on my front door and a path leading to it. This can be seen as communicating to

200
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:30,880
couriers that I want them to deliver packages by walking up to my door over my path and

201
0:13:30,880 --> 0:13:34,960
placing packages inside the mailbox. This demonstrates the limits of what Kinsella dubs

202
0:13:34,960 --> 0:13:38,640
armchair theorizing. One cannot say with certainty whether a given action is aggression without

203
0:13:38,640 --> 0:13:43,000
having all the relevant information provided, which is why judges are necessary in a rational

204
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:47,040
legal system. The judge is able to analyze all the relevant details to determine who

205
0:13:47,040 --> 0:13:51,080
is at fault. The job of the jurist sitting in his armchair is to explicate objective

206
0:13:51,080 --> 0:13:55,120
principles and perhaps to apply them to very simple hypothetical scenarios where all the

207
0:13:55,120 --> 0:14:22,960
relevant details can be provided.
