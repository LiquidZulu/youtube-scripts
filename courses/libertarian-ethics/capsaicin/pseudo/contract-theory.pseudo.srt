0:00:15,320 --> 0:00:16,320
4. Contract Theory

3
0:00:16,320 --> 0:00:20,000
The right of property implies the right to make contracts about that property.

4
0:00:20,000 --> 0:00:23,240
To give it away or exchange titles of ownership for the property of another person.

5
0:00:23,240 --> 0:00:27,120
Unfortunately, many libertarians devoted the right to make contracts hold the contract

6
0:00:27,120 --> 0:00:31,560
itself to be an absolute, and therefore maintain that any voluntary contract whatsoever must

7
0:00:31,560 --> 0:00:34,360
be legally enforceable in the free society.

8
0:00:34,360 --> 0:00:36,000
Marry Rothbard

9
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,920
As stated in the opening quote, property theory lies antecedent contract theory.

10
0:00:39,920 --> 0:00:43,240
That is, the right to make contracts is implied by the right to own property, and not the other way around.

11
0:00:43,240 --> 0:00:44,240
First, recall that property rights are conflict avoiding norms.

12
0:00:44,240 --> 0:00:47,160
The owner is said to be a man who can justly control the resource in question,

13
0:00:47,160 --> 0:00:50,360
but these ownership rights are not set in stone.

14
0:00:50,360 --> 0:00:52,240
The owner of a property may abandon it or transfer title to someone else.

15
0:00:52,240 --> 0:00:55,640
Consider Crusoe leaving his stick to rot after he's finished spearfishing.

16
0:00:55,640 --> 0:00:58,560
If he no longer considers it to be a good which he's acting with,

17
0:00:58,560 --> 0:01:01,840
Friday is capable of possessing it without there being any conflict.

18
0:01:01,840 --> 0:01:04,120
In other words, owning anything involves actually possessing it,

19
0:01:04,120 --> 0:01:07,880
along with the intent to direct the use of it.

20
0:01:07,880 --> 0:01:08,880
If you lose this intent, you no longer own it.

21
0:01:08,880 --> 0:01:11,040
This is abandonment, where a property is simply ceded back into nature,

22
0:01:11,040 --> 0:01:14,640
ripe for someone else to homestead it.

23
0:01:14,640 --> 0:01:16,080
Recall that such abandonment must be objective and inter-subjectively ascertainable.

24
0:01:16,080 --> 0:01:19,360
The latter case of a man transferring title to someone else is the subject of the theory of contracts.

25
0:01:19,360 --> 0:01:22,480
The question of concern is what types of contracts are enforceable and why.

26
0:01:22,480 --> 0:01:23,600
Allow me to first construct the basic case of Crusoe transferring ownership of his stick to Friday.

27
0:01:23,600 --> 0:01:26,960
For this to be a transfer and not an abandonment,

28
0:01:26,960 --> 0:01:30,160
Crusoe must relinquish control at the same time that Friday takes up control

29
0:01:30,160 --> 0:01:31,160
and each man must have the goal of the transfer going forth.

30
0:01:31,160 --> 0:01:34,520
That is to say, there exists no time between Crusoe and Friday's ownership where the stick was unowned.

31
0:01:34,520 --> 0:01:37,800
This means that a third man, Xury, could not come along and quickly swoop in on the property and thereby homestead it.

32
0:01:37,800 --> 0:01:38,800
It's clear that Friday now has title to the property.

33
0:01:38,800 --> 0:01:41,480
In short, a transfer of title to the stick from Crusoe to Friday

34
0:01:41,480 --> 0:01:42,480
involves Crusoe abandoning the stick at the same time that Friday homesteads it.

35
0:01:42,480 --> 0:01:46,000
What makes this transfer an enforceable contract is that if Crusoe does not

36
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:47,000
physically go through with giving up the stick, he has implicitly committed theft.

37
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,200
The stick belongs to Friday now and Crusoe is using it against Friday's consent.

38
0:01:49,200 --> 0:01:52,880
This is because Crusoe's agreement to the contract is evidence

39
0:01:52,880 --> 0:01:55,240
that he wishes to relinquish control, to abandon the stick,

40
0:01:55,240 --> 0:01:59,000
he can't deny this without contradiction.

41
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,880
It is therefore those contracts where defaulting would imply aggression that are enforceable.

42
0:02:01,880 --> 0:02:05,280
Consider a mere promise.

43
0:02:05,280 --> 0:02:08,240
Say a woman agrees to marry her boyfriend but does not go through with it.

44
0:02:08,240 --> 0:02:11,680
She has gone back on her word but she has not violated the boyfriend's consent.

45
0:02:11,680 --> 0:02:15,760
Therefore, mere promises like this are not enforceable.

46
0:02:15,760 --> 0:02:16,920
A promise is only enforceable to the extent they imply the transfer of property titles.

47
0:02:16,920 --> 0:02:19,840
In such a case, the property may be repossessed by its now owner.

48
0:02:19,840 --> 0:02:23,280
This theory of contract is called the title-transfer theory for this reason.

49
0:02:23,280 --> 0:02:25,760
To sum up, only those contracts which define the terms of the transfer of title to alienable property are legitimate.

50
0:02:25,760 --> 0:02:29,560
Furthermore, conditional transfers are also legitimate.

51
0:02:29,560 --> 0:02:32,440
Say that Crusoe agrees to transfer title to the stick to Friday

52
0:02:32,440 --> 0:02:35,800
on the condition that Friday performs a dance.

53
0:02:35,800 --> 0:02:39,880
Upon Friday meeting the condition set forth by Crusoe, title to the stick is transferred to him.

54
0:02:39,880 --> 0:02:41,320
This is because the intention made clear by both Crusoe and Friday

55
0:02:41,320 --> 0:02:43,840
that Friday was the just director of the use of the stick upon the condition being met.

56
0:02:43,840 --> 0:02:46,520
It will be seen in a later lesson why Crusoe would be "estopped" from challenging Friday's ownership.

57
0:02:46,520 --> 0:02:47,920
That is to say, Crusoe could not coherently deny that Friday owns the stick

58
0:02:47,920 --> 0:02:51,320
upon the condition being met.

59
0:02:51,320 --> 0:02:52,320
A

60
0:02:52,320 --> 0:02:55,400
A

61
0:02:55,400 --> 0:02:57,680
What is important is that on this theory a contract is not a piece of paper.

62
0:02:57,680 --> 0:03:01,680
The piece of paper is rather evidence of a contract existing.

63
0:03:01,680 --> 0:03:02,680
The contract can be verbal, agreed to via semaphore,

64
0:03:02,680 --> 0:03:05,720
or any matter of other methods of communication.

65
0:03:05,720 --> 0:03:06,720
All that a piece of signed paper can do is serve as evidence

66
0:03:06,720 --> 0:03:09,440
that a given contract was communicated and agreed upon by all the parties in question.

67
0:03:09,440 --> 0:03:12,040
An interesting implication of this theory is that

68
0:03:12,040 --> 0:03:15,560
there isn't really such a thing as breaching or breaking a contract.

69
0:03:15,560 --> 0:03:16,560
If A and B agree that B will transfer to A a sum of 10 ounces of silver on the condition

70
0:03:16,560 --> 0:03:19,600
that A performs magic at B's birthday party,

71
0:03:19,600 --> 0:03:22,680
A has not violated B's rights by not showing up.

72
0:03:22,680 --> 0:03:25,280
If B wanted to concourage A to go through with the deal,

73
0:03:25,280 --> 0:03:27,240
he simply need bake in a penalty clause stating that

74
0:03:27,240 --> 0:03:31,040
A transfers to B a sum of 5 ounces of silver if he does not perform the magic.

75
0:03:31,040 --> 0:03:34,840
A

76
0:03:34,840 --> 0:03:35,840
A

77
0:03:35,840 --> 0:03:38,920
Still here, A does not breach the contract by not showing up.

78
0:03:38,920 --> 0:03:43,640
He has simply engaged in an action which the contract covers.

79
0:03:43,640 --> 0:03:44,640
The aggression would only be if A doesn't perform the magic and doesn't hand over the 5 ounces.

80
0:03:44,640 --> 0:03:48,040
Not because this would breach the terms of the contract,

81
0:03:48,040 --> 0:03:50,760
but because this would be a theft of 5 ounces of silver.

82
0:03:50,760 --> 0:03:54,000
Consider further the case of Smith agreeing to pay 50 lbs of gold for Jones' car.

83
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:55,240
Smith takes the car but refuses to hand over the 50 lbs of gold to Jones.

84
0:03:55,240 --> 0:03:57,920
Has Smith stolen the car or the 50 lbs of gold?

85
0:03:57,920 --> 0:03:59,960
Well, if Smith actually has 50 lbs of gold,

86
0:03:59,960 --> 0:04:03,440
then title to it was instantly transferred to Jones upon the contract being accepted.

87
0:04:03,440 --> 0:04:06,600
Thus, it is the gold that has been stolen.

88
0:04:06,600 --> 0:04:08,960
On the other hand, if Smith does not have 50 lbs of gold,

89
0:04:08,960 --> 0:04:11,360
then the condition for the transfer of the car has not been met,

90
0:04:11,360 --> 0:04:14,920
so Jones would still own the car and that is what Smith has stolen.

91
0:04:14,920 --> 0:04:17,120
Fraud can be defined as theft by trick, i.e. is a theft performed by deceiving the victim.

92
0:04:17,120 --> 0:04:20,720
Consider the example where Crusoe has blunted the tip of his spear

93
0:04:20,720 --> 0:04:25,320
and that's why he wants to get rid of it.

94
0:04:25,320 --> 0:04:26,320
Crusoe lies to Friday and claims that the spear is as sharp as a razor.

95
0:04:26,320 --> 0:04:30,960
This is fraud.

96
0:04:30,960 --> 0:04:34,080
Crusoe has deceived Friday about the nature of the spear.

97
0:04:34,080 --> 0:04:35,080
This means that it was not a valid contract.

98
0:04:35,080 --> 0:04:38,000
Crusoe did not have the intention of transferring title to a sharp spear to Friday

99
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and therefore the contract is null.

100
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,400
A

101
0:04:41,400 --> 0:04:43,720
A

102
0:04:43,720 --> 0:04:47,520
If Friday had given Crusoe some seashells in exchange, Crusoe has implicitly stolen those shells.

103
0:04:47,520 --> 0:04:48,880
A particularly prevalent example of fraud is found in fractional reserve banking.

104
0:04:48,880 --> 0:04:52,320
The fractional reserve bank keeps only some fraction of the money deposited and loans out the rest.

105
0:04:52,320 --> 0:04:53,320
Consider a full reserve bank.

106
0:04:53,320 --> 0:04:57,040
Various people come and deposit 100 ounces of gold

107
0:04:57,040 --> 0:05:00,720
and the bank therefore gives these depositors in total certificates for 100 ounces of gold.

108
0:05:00,720 --> 0:05:01,880
Here there is a one-to-one correspondence between titles to gold,

109
0:05:01,880 --> 0:05:03,440
evidenced by the certificates, and actual gold and the vault.

110
0:05:03,440 --> 0:05:06,760
Consider what would happen if this bank decided to implement an 80% reserve policy

111
0:05:06,760 --> 0:05:09,960
and they therefore loaned out 20 ounces of gold.

112
0:05:09,960 --> 0:05:13,440
This would mean that the bank has stolen that gold

113
0:05:13,440 --> 0:05:15,040
because there is already a one-to-one correspondence between property titles in the gold held by the depositors

114
0:05:15,040 --> 0:05:18,800
and actual gold in the vault.

115
0:05:18,800 --> 0:05:20,720
Therefore, the bank is committing a fraud in deceiving people into the belief that they actually hold title to that gold.

116
0:05:20,720 --> 0:05:24,320
Perhaps instead of physically loaning out the gold,

117
0:05:24,320 --> 0:05:28,240
they keep all of the gold they have, but they give out 20 ounces worth of certificates for gold.

118
0:05:28,240 --> 0:05:31,040
This would still be fraud because there would be 120 ounces worth of titles to gold but only 100 ounces of gold.

119
0:05:31,040 --> 0:05:33,160
A

120
0:05:33,160 --> 0:05:35,640
A

121
0:05:35,640 --> 0:05:38,240
A

122
0:05:38,240 --> 0:05:41,720
More property titles and than actual property

123
0:05:41,720 --> 0:05:43,320
implies that people being deceived about the nature of property in existence,

124
0:05:43,320 --> 0:05:46,640
which therefore means there is fraud.

125
0:05:46,640 --> 0:05:50,600
Often so called free banking exporters will hold that the right of the people to make

126
0:05:50,600 --> 0:05:53,560
whatever contracts they expect to be advantageous means that such fractional reserve banks are not criminal institutions.

127
0:05:53,560 --> 0:05:57,320
But as we have seen, these people are misunderstanding the nature of property and contracts.

128
0:05:57,320 --> 0:05:58,800
It is not the case that one is able to make whatever contracts they want so long as everyone agrees to it.

129
0:05:58,800 --> 0:06:02,520
Property theory lies antecedent to contract theory,

130
0:06:02,520 --> 0:06:06,200
therefore a contract which misrepresents the actual nature of property and existence is invalid.

131
0:06:06,200 --> 0:06:07,360
This is not to say that a fractional reserve casino game is fraudulent,

132
0:06:07,360 --> 0:06:11,360
but representing this casino game as a bank is.

133
0:06:11,360 --> 0:06:14,080
A bank is a money warehouse, not a casino game.

134
0:06:14,080 --> 0:06:17,320
Such a casino game would not involve people deposting their money in their account

135
0:06:17,320 --> 0:06:21,920
and retaining title as evidenced by money substitutes.

136
0:06:21,920 --> 0:06:25,720
Such a game would involve people transferring their money to the casino

137
0:06:25,720 --> 0:06:28,040
in order for the casino to engage in some gambling algorithm with it.

138
0:06:28,040 --> 0:06:31,120
So fractional reserve banking is fraud, fractional reserve roulette is not.

139
0:06:31,120 --> 0:06:33,840
The definition of fraud in terms of deception is another concept

140
0:06:33,840 --> 0:06:38,200
that highlights the importance of communication to libertarian theory.

141
0:06:38,200 --> 0:06:41,640
Just as me loaning my friend 5 ounces of silver

142
0:06:41,640 --> 0:06:43,360
is not me deposting my money in account held by my friend,

143
0:06:43,360 --> 0:06:47,080
is me transferring that silver to him.

144
0:06:47,080 --> 0:06:50,240
So too is me placing a bet with a casino, not me disposing money in account,

145
0:06:50,240 --> 0:06:55,000
is me transferring that bet to them.

146
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:56,080
This concept of a loan is relevant to the question of debtors prison.

147
0:06:56,080 --> 0:06:59,120
The question is twofold, if A loans B 1000 ounces of silver in exchange for 1050 ounces of

148
0:06:59,120 --> 0:07:04,000
silver in one year's time, but B defaults, has he stolen from A, and second, would A

149
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
be permitted to put B to work in a debtors prison to pay off the stolen sum?

150
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,760
For the former question, if it is the case that B has stolen from A, what has he stolen?

151
0:07:12,760 --> 0:07:16,880
The 1000 ounces or the 1050 ounces?

152
0:07:16,880 --> 0:07:19,320
He surely hasn't stolen the 1000 ounces

153
0:07:19,320 --> 0:07:23,000
because that money was transferred to him at the time of the contract, such that he could invest in his various projects.

154
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
If it was not transferred, there would be no loan in the first place.

155
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,320
It also cannot be the case that it wasn't theft at the time,

156
0:07:29,320 --> 0:07:32,800
but it is retroactively at the time when he defaults.

157
0:07:32,800 --> 0:07:33,800
A property theory must assign a definite owner to any scarce resource at all times.

158
0:07:33,800 --> 0:07:38,360
If retroactive theft is such a thing in your property theory,

159
0:07:38,360 --> 0:07:41,840
there exists Schrödinger's property whose owner cannot be determined right here and now,

160
0:07:41,840 --> 0:07:45,840
such that conflicts over its use may be avoided.

161
0:07:45,840 --> 0:07:47,400
Schrödinger's property must therefore be expelled from our rational theory,

162
0:07:47,400 --> 0:07:51,920
and as such, the notion of retroactive theft must also.

163
0:07:51,920 --> 0:07:57,040
The question here is who owns the 1000 ounces immediately after the contract is accepted?

164
0:07:57,040 --> 0:07:58,680
A or B?

165
0:07:58,680 --> 0:08:00,160
If A then B has no right to invest these funds and there is no contract to speak of.

166
0:08:00,160 --> 0:08:05,000
If B, then it cannot be that B has stolen 1000 ounces because he had title to it.

167
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:09,720
Furthermore, it also can't be said that B has stolen the 1050 ounces.

168
0:08:09,720 --> 0:08:13,120
For if B has defaulted, that means that he does not possess 1050 ounces to silver.

169
0:08:13,120 --> 0:08:17,320
So how could he possibly have stolen it if it doesn't exist?

170
0:08:17,320 --> 0:08:20,200
Of course, if B actually does possess said sum of money and simply refuses to hand it over,

171
0:08:20,200 --> 0:08:24,720
this is not strictly speaking a default on the loan, it is rather B stealing that sum of money.

172
0:08:24,720 --> 0:08:28,320
These future-oriented contracts are called aleatory contracts.

173
0:08:28,320 --> 0:08:29,320
They have an implied clause of "unless it's impossible."

174
0:08:29,320 --> 0:08:32,440
This because the future is uncertain.

175
0:08:32,440 --> 0:08:35,640
Just as you cannot contract a transfer title to a square circle,

176
0:08:35,640 --> 0:08:37,680
you cannot contract a transfer money that doesn't exist.

177
0:08:37,680 --> 0:08:41,280
So in such loan arrangements, there must be an implicit condition that the funds actually exist on the due date.

178
0:08:41,280 --> 0:08:43,200
After all, what if B was vaporized in a nuclear explosion, along with the funds,

179
0:08:43,200 --> 0:08:47,240
one week after the contract was accepted?

180
0:08:47,240 --> 0:08:49,080
Upon the money coming due, has the now-dead B robbed A from beyond the grave?

181
0:08:49,080 --> 0:08:53,080
What if everyone except A has died in that explosion?

182
0:08:53,080 --> 0:08:54,640
If nobody else exists, it is nonsensical to speak of anyone being criminal towards A.

183
0:08:54,640 --> 0:08:59,160
In short, it's not theft unless something was stolen, and it's not fraud unless there was deception.

184
0:08:59,160 --> 0:09:01,680
A

185
0:09:01,680 --> 0:09:06,400
A

186
0:09:06,400 --> 0:09:10,000
There is no deception in the case of an aleatory contract on the part B,

187
0:09:10,000 --> 0:09:11,000
as he's not deceiving A into thinking he has what he does not.

188
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,880
Everyone knows that the future is uncertain, B has made no claims to the contrary.

189
0:09:14,880 --> 0:09:17,080
Whilst it's not relevant to legal theory as such how A can successfully get around this hurdle,

190
0:09:17,080 --> 0:09:20,640
I think it is important to give some notion as to how future-oriented contracts are still possible and reasonable.

191
0:09:20,640 --> 0:09:23,880
First, A need only bake in some interest clause.

192
0:09:23,880 --> 0:09:27,560
Perhaps each month that passes B owes A a further 1% on top of the initial 1050 ounces,

193
0:09:27,560 --> 0:09:29,240
such that when B acquires a requisite sum of money, title to it is immediately transferred to A.

194
0:09:29,240 --> 0:09:32,400
Furthermore, it is not the job of law to make sure that A makes a profit on the loan.

195
0:09:32,400 --> 0:09:37,240
Some loans go bad.

196
0:09:37,240 --> 0:09:41,120
It is an entrepreneurial activity, and as such, it is per se uncertain.

197
0:09:41,120 --> 0:09:42,120
The fact that the loan goes bad and A doesn't make a return

198
0:09:42,120 --> 0:09:46,040
is not sufficient grounds to justify A locking up B in a prison and working him as a slave.

199
0:09:46,040 --> 0:09:47,040
A

200
0:09:47,040 --> 0:09:51,280
A

201
0:09:51,280 --> 0:09:55,360
With our solid understanding of contract theory,

202
0:09:55,360 --> 0:09:59,360
we can analyze the debate surrounding voluntary slavery and determine the correct answer.

203
0:09:59,360 --> 0:10:02,900
The debate essentially centers around whether a man's self-ownership is alienable or not.

204
0:10:02,900 --> 0:10:05,080
That is to say, the question is whether it's legitimate to transfer ownership of oneself to another person.

205
0:10:05,080 --> 0:10:08,760
The former view is most notably held by Walter Block, and it can be summed up as follows:

206
0:10:08,760 --> 0:10:11,600
A

207
0:10:11,600 --> 0:10:12,600
A

208
0:10:12,600 --> 0:10:15,880
A

209
0:10:15,880 --> 0:10:16,880
A

210
0:10:16,880 --> 0:10:20,080
The underlying point of the libertarian critique is that if I own something, I can sell it,

211
0:10:20,080 --> 0:10:21,560
and should be allowed by a law to do so.

212
0:10:21,560 --> 0:10:24,720
If I can't sell it, then, and to that extent, I don't really own it.

213
0:10:24,720 --> 0:10:28,480
Taking my own liberty as perhaps the paradigm case of the debate over inalienability.

214
0:10:28,480 --> 0:10:31,560
The claim is that if I really own my liberty, then I should be free to dispose of it as

215
0:10:31,560 --> 0:10:32,560
I please.

216
0:10:32,560 --> 0:10:34,920
Even if, by so doing, I end up no longer owning it.

217
0:10:34,920 --> 0:10:38,000
Clearly, since I cannot own a square circle, I cannot sell it.

218
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:40,600
If I can own my ability to give true love, then I can sell it.

219
0:10:40,600 --> 0:10:44,400
If, logically, I cannot own this attribute, then, of course, I can't give, barter or sell

220
0:10:44,400 --> 0:10:45,400
it to anyone.

221
0:10:45,400 --> 0:10:49,320
My thesis: no law should be enacted prohibiting or even limiting in any way people's rights

222
0:10:49,320 --> 0:10:51,000
to alienate those things they own.

223
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:53,920
This is full-momenty alienability or commodification.

224
0:10:53,920 --> 0:10:57,240
So for a voluntary slavery contract to be a legitimate, (1) you must own yourself in the first place,

225
0:10:57,240 --> 0:10:59,920
and (2) you must be able to sell yourself.

226
0:10:59,920 --> 0:11:02,920
Walter's contention with other libertarians is that there does not exist objects which are ownable but not sellable.

227
0:11:02,920 --> 0:11:04,400
The standard example of a contract pertaining to the sale of a square circle is illegitimate

228
0:11:04,400 --> 0:11:07,920
because you can't own a square circle in the first place.

229
0:11:07,920 --> 0:11:10,080
This would imply that because people own themselves in the first place,

230
0:11:10,080 --> 0:11:13,120
they can therefore sell themselves.

231
0:11:13,120 --> 0:11:14,120
A prominent counter-argument to this thesis was forwarded by Rothbard in his Ethics of Liberty.

232
0:11:14,120 --> 0:11:17,400
A

233
0:11:17,400 --> 0:11:18,400
A

234
0:11:18,400 --> 0:11:21,680
The distinction between a man's alienable labor service and his inalienable will may

235
0:11:21,680 --> 0:11:22,680
be further explained.

236
0:11:22,680 --> 0:11:26,560
A man can alienate his labor service, but he cannot sell the capitalized future value

237
0:11:26,560 --> 0:11:27,560
of that service.

238
0:11:27,560 --> 0:11:31,160
In short, he cannot, in nature, sell himself into slavery and have the sale enforced.

239
0:11:31,160 --> 0:11:33,760
This would mean that his future will, over his own person, was being surrendered in

240
0:11:33,760 --> 0:11:34,760
advance.

241
0:11:34,760 --> 0:11:38,120
In short, a man can naturally expend his labor currently for someone else's benefit.

242
0:11:38,120 --> 0:11:41,520
But he cannot transfer himself, even if he wished, into another man's permanent capital

243
0:11:41,520 --> 0:11:45,280
good, for he cannot rid himself of his own will, which may change in future years and

244
0:11:45,280 --> 0:11:46,800
repudiate the current arrangement.

245
0:11:46,800 --> 0:11:50,360
The concept of voluntary slavery is indeed a contradictory one, for so long as a laborer

246
0:11:50,360 --> 0:11:54,200
remains totally subservient to his master's will voluntarily, he's not yet to slave,

247
0:11:54,200 --> 0:11:55,720
since his submission is voluntary.

248
0:11:55,720 --> 0:11:59,080
Whereas if he later changes his mind and the master enforced his slavery by violence,

249
0:11:59,080 --> 0:12:01,040
the slavery would not then be voluntary.

250
0:12:01,040 --> 0:12:03,240
There are several ways a Blockean might respond to this attack.

251
0:12:03,240 --> 0:12:06,400
Firstly, he could point the frontal lobotomy as a procedure which makes a person akin to

252
0:12:06,400 --> 0:12:08,000
an animal in terms of thinking.

253
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:10,160
Perhaps there could be a pill or machine invented in the future which would nullify

254
0:12:10,160 --> 0:12:14,160
only those parts of a man's brain, which were responsible for his conceptual faculties.

255
0:12:14,160 --> 0:12:17,400
Surely a man who underwent a procedure such as these would have, indeed, potentially permanently,

256
0:12:17,400 --> 0:12:21,440
subdued his will such that he may be more effectively directed by his enslaver.

257
0:12:21,440 --> 0:12:25,200
This would mean that voluntary slavery is not per se illegitimate, but rather is only

258
0:12:25,200 --> 0:12:28,320
illegitimate where men cannot figure out how to subdue the slave's will.

259
0:12:28,320 --> 0:12:31,560
Furthermore, it's not the will which is relevant to the voluntary slavery contract, but the body.

260
0:12:31,560 --> 0:12:32,560
So even if it is logically impossible to transfer the will of person A to person B,

261
0:12:32,560 --> 0:12:36,480
it may not be the case that it's impossible to transfer the body from A to B.

262
0:12:36,480 --> 0:12:39,720
After all, both the supporters and rejectors of the right to make slave contracts

263
0:12:39,720 --> 0:12:43,080
agree that it is possible to have someone as your slave.

264
0:12:43,080 --> 0:12:44,080
That is to say, it's possible for B to possess A.

265
0:12:44,080 --> 0:12:47,760
The question is whether it's possible for this to be a just possession.

266
0:12:47,760 --> 0:12:49,800
And on this note, let's recall the nature of a man's self-ownership.

267
0:12:49,800 --> 0:12:52,520
A body is necessarily and objectively linked to an acting man.

268
0:12:52,520 --> 0:12:55,320
It is this link which imbues a man with ownership.

269
0:12:55,320 --> 0:12:57,880
Anytime you argue with anyone, you must assume the primacy of this link

270
0:12:57,880 --> 0:13:01,560
and its validity in making the other person own their body.

271
0:13:01,560 --> 0:13:03,040
It is the argument from argument then which demonstrates the inalienability of the self.

272
0:13:03,040 --> 0:13:06,960
That is to say, ownership is just control, which means argumentatively justifiable control,

273
0:13:06,960 --> 0:13:11,720
and the very nature of argumentatively justifying anything implies a mutual recognition of self-ownership.

274
0:13:11,720 --> 0:13:15,640
Therefore, a master cannot justly possesses his slave, making voluntary slavery a contradiction in terms.

275
0:13:15,640 --> 0:13:16,640
A

276
0:13:16,640 --> 0:13:20,560
A

277
0:13:20,560 --> 0:13:21,560
Block rejects this notion of an objective link establishing ownership, stating the following:

278
0:13:21,560 --> 0:13:25,640
A

279
0:13:25,640 --> 0:13:27,960
Let us posit that you have a dog who is heart and soul with you.

280
0:13:27,960 --> 0:13:30,960
K9 dogs are said to have this sort of connection with their masters.

281
0:13:30,960 --> 0:13:35,200
According to Kinsella, not only would it be illegal to sell this dog, but also well-nigh logically

282
0:13:35,200 --> 0:13:37,000
impossible for this to occur.

283
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:41,160
Just as we all have the best link to my body, you too have the best link to this dog.

284
0:13:41,160 --> 0:13:43,200
You snap your fingers and the dog does your bidding.

285
0:13:43,200 --> 0:13:44,200
Not that of the neighbour.

286
0:13:44,200 --> 0:13:45,520
To whom you have sold the dog.

287
0:13:45,520 --> 0:13:49,000
The point is, the best link to in terms of control is clearly a way outside the bounds

288
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,480
of libertarian homesteading and property rights theory.

289
0:13:51,480 --> 0:13:55,000
Merely because someone has the best link to something does not mean that he is a necessarily

290
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:56,000
legitimate owner of it.

291
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:58,320
But the dog is clearly disanalogous to the human case.

292
0:13:58,320 --> 0:14:01,120
A dog is an external object, not a (human) body.

293
0:14:01,120 --> 0:14:03,400
What we have in the case of a dog that A wants to sell to B,

294
0:14:03,400 --> 0:14:07,200
is a case of either A or B "coercing" the dog to do their bidding.

295
0:14:07,200 --> 0:14:10,640
The dog is analogous to a machine gun that A may well be more adept at using.

296
0:14:10,640 --> 0:14:14,320
The point is not over who is more scientifically capable of using the object for some end though.

297
0:14:14,320 --> 0:14:17,640
If the dog was capable of acting and arguing, then indeed it would be a contradiction to

298
0:14:17,640 --> 0:14:21,640
assert that either A or B owned the dog, as they would have to recognize this dog's self-ownership.

299
0:14:21,640 --> 0:14:22,640
This is because the dog would then have an objective and undeniable link to his own dog body.

300
0:14:22,640 --> 0:14:26,040
A

301
0:14:26,040 --> 0:14:27,040
A

302
0:14:27,040 --> 0:14:30,040
The dog has no such link in reality because he cannot act or argue.

303
0:14:30,040 --> 0:14:32,880
The dog is in the same legal category as a machine gun.

304
0:14:32,880 --> 0:14:36,200
It may well be the case that A is more capable of using the dog for certain ends,

305
0:14:36,200 --> 0:14:39,720
but this is not enough to demonstrate a link as strong

306
0:14:39,720 --> 0:14:41,120
as it is between an actor-arguer and his own body.

307
0:14:41,120 --> 0:14:44,000
Moreover, a first-principles understanding of contract highlights the fact that for

308
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:49,600
A to transfer title of alpha to B, A must relinquish control, i.e. abandon alpha,

309
0:14:49,600 --> 0:14:50,800
at the same time that B takes up control.

310
0:14:50,800 --> 0:14:54,000
You cannot abandon your body without making yourself brain dead, so you cannot,

311
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,760
whilst remaining an actor, transfer title to your body.

312
0:14:56,760 --> 0:15:00,160
After all, such abandonment of the property would have to be objective and intersubjectively ascertainable.

313
0:15:00,160 --> 0:15:01,160
Merely decreeing that you no longer own yourself is not enough.

314
0:15:01,160 --> 0:15:03,760
What this means is that voluntary slavery is an impossibility.

315
0:15:03,760 --> 0:15:06,920
Insofar as you do make yourself brain dead and thus non-existent in the praxeologic sense,

316
0:15:06,920 --> 0:15:10,840
you cannot be said to consent or not consent to anything.

317
0:15:10,840 --> 0:15:13,600
It is not proper to say that the stick I appropriate from nature is consenting or not consenting to be my slave.

318
0:15:13,600 --> 0:15:17,180
A

319
0:15:17,180 --> 0:15:18,280
It is a stick, not a moral being capable of consent.

320
0:15:18,280 --> 0:15:21,240
Therefore, the closest that one can get to voluntary slavery

321
0:15:21,240 --> 0:15:24,520
is to render the so-called slave, incapable of action or argumentation,

322
0:15:24,520 --> 0:15:29,320
to completely destroy their will in Rothbardian terms,

323
0:15:29,320 --> 0:15:32,880
and thus make this person legally analogous to a corpse.

324
0:15:32,880 --> 0:15:36,400
Rothbard therefore already had the shape of this idea in his mind, but spoke of it using

325
0:15:36,400 --> 0:15:38,720
the confusing terminology of will transfer.

326
0:15:38,720 --> 0:15:42,320
As Block says, "will schmill!"

327
0:15:42,320 --> 0:15:43,880
Whether you can literally transfer or suppress a will of an acting being isn't relevant.

328
0:15:43,880 --> 0:15:48,280
What is relevant, however, and what Rothbard was on the cusp of is that consent does matter.

329
0:15:48,280 --> 0:15:51,440
Merely promising in the present that you will do whatever your master says, that you will

330
0:15:51,440 --> 0:15:53,840
be their slave, does not mean that they own you.

331
0:15:53,840 --> 0:15:55,960
Mere promises do not establish this.

332
0:15:55,960 --> 0:15:58,840
You can always change your mind in the future and revoke consent.

333
0:15:58,840 --> 0:16:02,000
Consider the case of your girlfriend agreeing to have sex with you tomorrow after dinner.

334
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,160
The time comes and you are getting ready to do the deed, but she changes her mind and

335
0:16:05,160 --> 0:16:08,000
tells you that she no longer wants to go forward with the arrangement.

336
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:10,440
But is she not my slave for the purposes of this contract?

337
0:16:10,440 --> 0:16:12,840
She agreed before that she would obey my wishes on the matter.

338
0:16:12,840 --> 0:16:15,280
So am I permitted to have sex with her, or would this be rape?

339
0:16:15,280 --> 0:16:18,480
Clearly the latter is true, just because she gave her consent before,

340
0:16:18,480 --> 0:16:20,320
does not imply that she cannot revoke this consent.

341
0:16:20,320 --> 0:16:22,600
The same is true for all voluntary slavery.

342
0:16:22,600 --> 0:16:26,640
Merely agreeing now to always obey the master's wishes does not transfer ownership of anything.

343
0:16:26,640 --> 0:16:30,600
The Rothbardian analysis is also absolutely correct in that demolition of the will would

344
0:16:30,600 --> 0:16:34,120
allow a body to be owned by another, but only because this demolition of will would render

345
0:16:34,120 --> 0:16:36,000
the individual analogous to a corpse.

346
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:39,840
It is therefore not all that surprising that one cannot sell their body, whilst remaining alive.

347
0:16:39,840 --> 0:16:40,840
After all, as discussed earlier, the two methods of alienation are title transfer and abandonment.

348
0:16:40,840 --> 0:16:45,560
We already accept that it's not possible for an actor to abandon their body.

349
0:16:45,560 --> 0:16:48,520
What the above analysis shows is that it's also not possible to alienate your body through title-transfer either.

350
0:16:48,520 --> 0:16:51,760
Moreover, as discussed above, for title-transfer to be possible in the first place,

351
0:16:51,760 --> 0:16:53,320
you have to be able to abandon the thing in question.

352
0:16:53,320 --> 0:16:56,720
A

353
0:16:56,720 --> 0:16:58,520
If A wants to transfer title of alpha to B,

354
0:16:58,520 --> 0:17:02,280
what A must do is abandon title to alpha at the same time that B takes up title to alpha.

355
0:17:02,280 --> 0:17:04,280
This first step of abandonment cannot occur in bodies,

356
0:17:04,280 --> 0:17:07,760
and therefore ownership of bodies cannot be transferred.

357
0:17:07,760 --> 0:17:09,000
The only exception is when the person in question dies or is rendered brain dead,

358
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,400
at this point their body is indeed abandoned in nature,

359
0:17:12,400 --> 0:17:16,280
and as such the only valid way to transfer title to your own body is by doing so in a last will and testament.

360
0:17:16,280 --> 0:17:19,880
It is a mistake to see property and external objects as being equivalent

361
0:17:19,880 --> 0:17:23,200
to property in bodies, and then using the fact that you can

362
0:17:23,200 --> 0:17:26,120
trade external objects to claim that you can also trade bodies.

363
0:17:26,120 --> 0:17:27,480
Ownership is the right to control a scarce resource.

364
0:17:27,480 --> 0:17:29,240
It takes an additional step to say that you can give up that right,

365
0:17:29,240 --> 0:17:32,360
or that other people could take it in.

366
0:17:32,360 --> 0:17:33,360
The confusion on this matter is derived from a conflation between two different senses of the word "ownership."

367
0:17:33,360 --> 0:17:36,200
A

368
0:17:36,200 --> 0:17:37,400
In this course, great attention has been paid to the legal sense of this word,

369
0:17:37,400 --> 0:17:40,560
but there is also such a thing as catallactic ownership,

370
0:17:40,560 --> 0:17:44,280
which is the sense used by economists.

371
0:17:44,280 --> 0:17:48,040
This is why an economist might say something like A sells as labor services for five ounces of gold to B.

372
0:17:48,040 --> 0:17:49,040
A

373
0:17:49,040 --> 0:17:51,560
To the legal theorist such a sentence is incoherent.

374
0:17:51,560 --> 0:17:54,360
The labor isn't owned by anyone, and thus isn't being traded.

375
0:17:54,360 --> 0:17:57,720
It doesn't make sense to say that someone owns their labor,

376
0:17:57,720 --> 0:17:59,440
labor is something that you do with things that you own.

377
0:17:59,440 --> 0:18:01,800
After all, what would it mean to exclude someone from your labor?

378
0:18:01,800 --> 0:18:05,080
Thus, in the legal sense, this is clearly ludicrous,

379
0:18:05,080 --> 0:18:06,080
but the economist does not mean the same thing.

380
0:18:06,080 --> 0:18:10,120
What the economist means by ownership is more akin to possession or control,

381
0:18:10,120 --> 0:18:12,800
as the economist is not concerned with whether said control or possession is just.

382
0:18:12,800 --> 0:18:16,040
A certainly does control his labor, at least in the economic sense.

383
0:18:16,040 --> 0:18:19,320
He can choose to employ his labor for whatever line of production he sees fit.

384
0:18:19,320 --> 0:18:22,360
And in the economic sense, it makes sense to speak of him trading this labor with other people.

385
0:18:22,360 --> 0:18:23,360
A

386
0:18:23,360 --> 0:18:26,080
But one should not then bring such an analysis into legal matters.

387
0:18:26,080 --> 0:18:27,600
Such would be a dreadful mistake.

388
0:18:27,600 --> 0:18:30,880
The voluntary slavery contract is the paramount example of this mistake.

389
0:18:30,880 --> 0:18:33,760
Block's argument hinges on the notion that if you own something you can sell it, and vice versa.

390
0:18:33,760 --> 0:18:34,760
A

391
0:18:34,760 --> 0:18:38,000
But it is simply not the case that ownership implies selling, or that selling implies ownership.

392
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:42,080
I can sell a bitcoin, or an idea, or my labor,

393
0:18:42,080 --> 0:18:43,080
and yet I do not own any of these things in the legal sense.

394
0:18:43,080 --> 0:18:46,560
Similarly, owning something does not imply the right to sell it,

395
0:18:46,560 --> 0:18:47,760
as has been seen in the case with the one's body.

396
0:18:47,760 --> 0:18:51,360
It is possible to alienate some parts, or even all of your body, though.

397
0:18:51,360 --> 0:18:52,800
Consider Crusoe chopping off his arm.

398
0:18:52,800 --> 0:18:55,040
Upon chopping the arm off, it is alienable.

399
0:18:55,040 --> 0:18:59,640
Crusoe is able to abandon, or trade it at will,

400
0:18:59,640 --> 0:19:00,640
because he is no longer objectively and undeniably linked to his arm.

401
0:19:00,640 --> 0:19:04,080
A similar case exists with respect to one's entire body, in the case of death.

402
0:19:04,080 --> 0:19:08,280
If Crusoe sets to paper that, upon the condition that he dies,

403
0:19:08,280 --> 0:19:11,160
ownership of his body is transferred to Friday, then this is a legitimate contract.

404
0:19:11,160 --> 0:19:15,000
The instant the condition is met, Crusoe's body becomes alienable,

405
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:16,000
just as surely as a stick or seashell.

406
0:19:16,000 --> 0:19:20,120
There could be no remaining objective link between Crusoe and his body

407
0:19:20,120 --> 0:19:21,520
at this point, because Crusoe has perished.

408
0:19:21,520 --> 0:19:25,720
He no longer possesses the potential to engage in any form of argumentation, and as such,

409
0:19:25,720 --> 0:19:28,680
third parties are not in contradiction by claiming to own him.

410
0:19:28,680 --> 0:19:32,720
This highlights why a last will and testament is a legitimate contract in general.

411
0:19:32,720 --> 0:19:35,960
Simply set the condition for whatever title transfers the will defines,

412
0:19:35,960 --> 0:19:36,960
to be the death of the owner.

413
0:19:36,960 --> 0:19:41,480
Should a man die who has no inheritors, his property, including his body,

414
0:19:41,480 --> 0:19:44,080
becomes instantly ceded to nature, ready for someone to homestead it.

415
0:19:44,080 --> 0:19:47,720
Therefore, if a man wishes his corpse to be treated in a certain way,

416
0:19:47,720 --> 0:20:13,160
he must transfer title to it to trusted family or a funeral home.
