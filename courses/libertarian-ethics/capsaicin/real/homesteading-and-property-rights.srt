0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:17,360
3. Homesteading and property rights

2
0:00:17,360 --> 0:00:21,120
The first user and possessor of a good is either its owner or his not. If he's not,

3
0:00:21,120 --> 0:00:25,040
then who is? The person who takes it from him by force? If forcefully taking possession

4
0:00:25,040 --> 0:00:28,600
from a prior owner entitles the new possessor to that thing, then there is no such thing

5
0:00:28,600 --> 0:00:32,200
as ownership, but only mere possession. But such a rule that a later user may acquire

6
0:00:32,200 --> 0:00:36,480
something by taking it from the previous owner does not avoid conflicts, it rather authorizes

7
0:00:36,480 --> 0:00:39,160
them. Stephan Kinsella.

8
0:00:39,160 --> 0:00:42,920
Now that the non-aggression principle has been demonstrated as an apodictically correct

9
0:00:42,920 --> 0:00:47,280
axiom of law, some initial implications can be derived, the first of which is the homesteading

10
0:00:47,280 --> 0:00:50,760
principle, which can be stated as ownership is assigned to the initial possessor/director

11
0:00:50,760 --> 0:00:55,000
of any external good, where homesteading is defined as initial possession. Note, it

12
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,240
is not particularly irrelevant whether you define homesteading as initial possession or

13
0:00:58,240 --> 0:01:01,440
initial direction. The initial possessor of the good is the one who initially directs

14
0:01:01,440 --> 0:01:05,440
the use of it. However, I prefer the terminology of direction, in most cases, as will be made

15
0:01:05,440 --> 0:01:09,080
clear later. You will often see this described as the prior later distinction.

16
0:01:09,080 --> 0:01:13,280
That is, the homesteading principle gives precedence to the first-comer over any late-comers.

17
0:01:13,280 --> 0:01:16,440
Consider Crusoe and Friday, stranded on a desert island. Crusoe comes across a stick

18
0:01:16,440 --> 0:01:20,520
in nature and homesteads it, i.e. takes initial possession of it. Then he fashions it into

19
0:01:20,520 --> 0:01:24,280
a spear which he plans to use for spearfishing. On his way to the ocean, however, Friday sees

20
0:01:24,280 --> 0:01:27,360
this stick and thinks it would be a useful tool to stoke his fire, and so he attempts

21
0:01:27,360 --> 0:01:31,640
to repossess it, that is, take it from Crusoe. We have a conflict. Crusoe can't spearfish

22
0:01:31,640 --> 0:01:35,040
at the same time that Friday stokes his fire, and it is intuitively clear that Friday has

23
0:01:35,040 --> 0:01:39,360
initiated this conflict. First, it must be noted that ownership is necessarily distinct

24
0:01:39,360 --> 0:01:44,000
from direction, and this is presupposed as true by both Crusoe and Friday. In asserting

25
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:46,960
different ownership claims, they are saying that they are the ones who justly direct

26
0:01:46,960 --> 0:01:50,920
the use of the stick, i.e., if someone else tries to do so, that is unjust. We know this

27
0:01:50,920 --> 0:01:54,440
because ownership itself is defined as just direction. Kinsella points out that

28
0:01:54,440 --> 0:01:57,960
the fact that ownership and direction are distinct implies that only the first possession/direction

29
0:01:57,960 --> 0:02:02,040
is justifiable. If B can become the owner of a thing merely by taking it from

30
0:02:02,040 --> 0:02:05,680
A, this means that C could take it from B and thereby become the owner. This would mean

31
0:02:05,680 --> 0:02:09,120
that the actual ability to direct the use of a thing and ownership of that thing are

32
0:02:09,120 --> 0:02:13,240
not distinct. Whoever is able to control a stick would be the owner, and this contradicts

33
0:02:13,240 --> 0:02:17,400
the presumption by all parties that ownership and direction are distinct. Therefore, as

34
0:02:17,400 --> 0:02:20,880
it is a contradiction to propose that a latecomer has a property right, we are left with the

35
0:02:20,880 --> 0:02:25,040
initial director having the only justifiable claims of property right. Initial direction

36
0:02:25,040 --> 0:02:29,120
is the only just direction, and therefore is only the homestead who has the unique status

37
0:02:29,120 --> 0:02:33,160
of ownership. In other words, we can see not only that locking homesteading is inextricably

38
0:02:33,160 --> 0:02:36,960
bound up with a prior later distinction, but that the very idea of ownership implies that

39
0:02:36,960 --> 0:02:41,800
only libertarian-style ownership is justifiable. So, property rights are conflict-avoiding norms

40
0:02:41,800 --> 0:02:45,360
and assigned to the first-comer rather than any late-comer, and from this fact we can

41
0:02:45,360 --> 0:02:50,000
derive a corollary about the nature of a legitimate homesteading claim, namely that the borders

42
0:02:50,000 --> 0:02:54,400
of said homesteaded property must be objective and intersubjectively ascertainable. This fact

43
0:02:54,400 --> 0:02:58,440
becomes clear when we break it down into its constituent parts. First, the borders of a

44
0:02:58,440 --> 0:03:02,320
homesteaded property must be objective, that is, they must adhere to existence as against

45
0:03:02,320 --> 0:03:06,040
the arbitrary content of one's consciousness. This is because subjective property borders

46
0:03:06,040 --> 0:03:10,040
might contradict, and thus a subjective system of property rights is irrational, and could

47
0:03:10,040 --> 0:03:13,880
not make for universal law. You will recall that law must be universal and objective to

48
0:03:13,880 --> 0:03:17,720
be rational. Consider a system of property rights based upon such arbitrary decrees.

49
0:03:17,720 --> 0:03:21,640
For example, A having the right to punch B, but B not having the right to punch A. This

50
0:03:21,640 --> 0:03:26,400
system would not be objective. Neither A nor B could rationally derive such a rule, and

51
0:03:26,400 --> 0:03:30,560
as such, you could not be expected to follow it. What this means is that an arbitrary system

52
0:03:30,560 --> 0:03:34,720
of property rights like this cannot avoid conflicts, it would rather authorize them.

53
0:03:34,720 --> 0:03:38,520
Now we turn to the criterion that property borders must be intersubjectively ascertainable.

54
0:03:38,520 --> 0:03:41,960
What this means is that they are "public," and can be seen or in some other way perceived

55
0:03:41,960 --> 0:03:45,360
by third parties. The reason why rational property borders must be intersubjectively

56
0:03:45,360 --> 0:03:49,600
ascertainable is that if they are not, they cannot serve to avoid conflicts, and property

57
0:03:49,600 --> 0:03:53,720
rights are conflict avoiding norms. Consider a non-intersubjectively ascertainable property

58
0:03:53,720 --> 0:03:57,800
border, such as a mere verbal decree. Robinson Crusoe decides that he wants to own the moon,

59
0:03:57,800 --> 0:04:01,320
so he simply shouts to the forest that he now owns the moon. Clearly, this verbal decree

60
0:04:01,320 --> 0:04:05,320
cannot serve to avoid conflicts. When an astronaut is approaching the moon, he has no means of

61
0:04:05,320 --> 0:04:09,000
discovering Crusoe's supposed property right in the moon. Thus, Crusoe has not actually

62
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,600
homesteaded the moon, he has not erected an objective, intersubjectively ascertainable border.

63
0:04:13,600 --> 0:04:17,360
No one could ever deny that norms for determining the ownership of scarce goods are useful for

64
0:04:17,360 --> 0:04:21,680
allowing conflict-free exploitation of such resources. But, as Hoppe points out, there

65
0:04:21,680 --> 0:04:25,280
are only two fundamental alternatives for acquiring unowned property.

66
0:04:25,280 --> 0:04:29,120
One, by doing something with things which no one else had ever done anything before,

67
0:04:29,120 --> 0:04:34,320
that is the Lockean concept of mixing labour, or homesteading, or two, by verbal declaration

68
0:04:34,320 --> 0:04:38,600
or decree. However, a rule that allows property to be owned by mere verbal declaration cannot

69
0:04:38,600 --> 0:04:42,880
serve to avoid conflicts, since any number of people could, at any time, assert conflicting

70
0:04:42,880 --> 0:04:46,880
claims of ownership of a particular scarce resource. Only the first alternative, that

71
0:04:46,880 --> 0:04:50,440
of Lockean homesteading, establishes an objective link between a particular person

72
0:04:50,440 --> 0:04:54,440
and a particular scarce resource. And thus, no one can deny the Lockean right to homestead

73
0:04:54,440 --> 0:04:58,400
unowned resources. What these criteria for rational property borders highlight is that

74
0:04:58,400 --> 0:05:02,480
communication lies at the very root of law. In homesteading a particular scarce resource,

75
0:05:02,480 --> 0:05:05,520
you have to be able to somehow communicate to others that you are using it. If you fail

76
0:05:05,520 --> 0:05:09,080
at this, you fail at your task of homesteading, and cannot be said to own the thing in the

77
0:05:09,080 --> 0:05:13,000
first place. An important edge-case must be analysed for this theory to be complete.

78
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,160
Namely, the instance of Crusoe and Friday simultaneously attempting to take possession

79
0:05:16,160 --> 0:05:20,040
of a stick in nature. Clearly, neither came prior to the other, so it is improper to describe

80
0:05:20,040 --> 0:05:24,360
either as the first- or late-comer. In this situation, Crusoe and Friday are in a stalemate,

81
0:05:24,360 --> 0:05:27,880
where the term stalemate is used to indicate that it is not a conflict. From the definition

82
0:05:27,880 --> 0:05:31,840
of the hypothetical, we know that neither Crusoe nor Friday have actually started engaging

83
0:05:31,840 --> 0:05:35,720
in their chosen action with the stick. As in the first instance, the stick was in nature,

84
0:05:35,720 --> 0:05:39,800
then in the very next, both Crusoe and Friday made an attempt to begin acting with it. This

85
0:05:39,800 --> 0:05:43,360
attempt is not yet complete, and the action has not yet started until the other backs

86
0:05:43,360 --> 0:05:47,360
off. Such a stalemate situation may turn into a conflict if either Crusoe or Friday forcefully

87
0:05:47,360 --> 0:05:50,600
excludes the other from completing their homesteading of the stick. This is a situation

88
0:05:50,600 --> 0:05:54,600
of the forceful one, say Crusoe, excluding the other from that which he does not own. This

89
0:05:54,600 --> 0:05:58,360
is an invasion from Crusoe against Friday, therefore Crusoe is the aggressor and not

90
0:05:58,360 --> 0:06:01,880
the proper owner of the stick. Clearly, there is now a conflict over the use of the stick,

91
0:06:01,880 --> 0:06:05,400
else Crusoe would not be excluding Friday from the stick, but from something else, and it is

92
0:06:05,400 --> 0:06:09,200
Crusoe who has initiated this conflict. Thus, to forcefully exclude the other in a stalemate

93
0:06:09,200 --> 0:06:13,200
situation is to disqualify yourself from ownership of the good under stalemate, thereby

94
0:06:13,200 --> 0:06:16,960
ceding ownership to the other. The simpler case is when either Crusoe or Friday decide

95
0:06:16,960 --> 0:06:20,600
that they will back off on their own, thus non-aggressively breaking the stalemate and

96
0:06:20,600 --> 0:06:24,080
ceding ownership to the other more stubborn man. Now we must turn our attention to the

97
0:06:24,080 --> 0:06:28,200
Georgist anti-homestead ethic, which would claim that the first possessor also doesn't

98
0:06:28,200 --> 0:06:31,360
have the ownership right, and in fact the homesteading itself is a crime against everyone

99
0:06:31,360 --> 0:06:35,320
else. This ethic fails in the grounds of its very proposal. To engage in an argumentation,

100
0:06:35,320 --> 0:06:38,840
one must first homestead something, at the very least their standing room. Before beginning

101
0:06:38,840 --> 0:06:43,440
any ethical deliberation, you must therefore accept it to be just, that is to say argumentatively

102
0:06:43,440 --> 0:06:47,480
justifiable, to take initial possession and to therefore initially direct the use of some

103
0:06:47,480 --> 0:06:52,080
scarce physical means. Hoppe explains that a late-comer ethic implies the death of humanity.

104
0:06:52,080 --> 0:06:55,920
What is wrong with this idea of dropping the prior later distinction as morally irrelevant?

105
0:06:55,920 --> 0:06:59,680
First, if the late-comers, i.e. those who did not in fact do something with some scarce

106
0:06:59,680 --> 0:07:03,480
goods, had indeed as much of a right to the most first-comers, i.e. those who did do

107
0:07:03,480 --> 0:07:07,280
something with the scarce goods, then literally no one would be allowed to do anything with

108
0:07:07,280 --> 0:07:10,560
anything, as one would have to have all of the late-comers consent prior to doing whatever

109
0:07:10,560 --> 0:07:14,480
one wanted to do. Indeed, as posterity would include one's children's children, people

110
0:07:14,480 --> 0:07:18,080
that is, who come so late that one could never possibly ask them. Advocating a legal

111
0:07:18,080 --> 0:07:21,160
system that does not make use of the prior later distinction as part of its underlying

112
0:07:21,160 --> 0:07:24,600
property theory is simply absurd in that it implies advocating death but must presuppose

113
0:07:24,600 --> 0:07:29,440
life in order to advocate anything. Neither we, our forefathers, nor our progeny could,

114
0:07:29,440 --> 0:07:33,960
do, or will survive and say or argue anything if one were to follow this rule. In order

115
0:07:33,960 --> 0:07:38,400
for any person, past, present, or future, to argue anything, it must be possible to survive

116
0:07:38,400 --> 0:07:42,320
now. No one can wait and suspend acting until everyone of an indeterminate class of late-comers

117
0:07:42,320 --> 0:07:46,160
happens to appear and agree to what one wants to do. Rather, insofar as a person finds

118
0:07:46,160 --> 0:07:50,240
himself alone, he must be able to act, to use, produce, consume goods straight away. Prior

119
0:07:50,240 --> 0:07:54,120
to any agreement with people who are simply not around yet, and perhaps never will be.

120
0:07:54,120 --> 0:07:57,160
And insofar as a person finds himself in the company of others, and there is conflict

121
0:07:57,160 --> 0:08:00,840
over how to use a given scarce resource, he must be able to resolve the problem at a definite

122
0:08:00,840 --> 0:08:04,520
point in time with a definite number of people, instead of having to wait unspecified periods

123
0:08:04,520 --> 0:08:08,160
of time for unspecified numbers of people. Simply in order to survive then, which is

124
0:08:08,160 --> 0:08:11,800
a prerequisite to arguing in favour of or against anything, property rights cannot be

125
0:08:11,800 --> 0:08:15,960
conceived of as being timeless and nonspecific regarding the number of people concerned. Rather,

126
0:08:15,960 --> 0:08:19,160
they must necessarily be thought of as originating through acting at definite points in time

127
0:08:19,160 --> 0:08:23,440
for definite acting individuals. Furthermore, the idea of abandoning the priorly to distinction,

128
0:08:23,440 --> 0:08:27,040
which socialism finds so attractive, would again simply be incompatible with the non-aggression

129
0:08:27,040 --> 0:08:30,760
principle as the practical foundation of argumentation. To argue and possibly agree

130
0:08:30,760 --> 0:08:34,360
with someone, if only on the fact that there is disagreement, means to recognise each other

131
0:08:34,360 --> 0:08:38,000
prior right of exclusive control over his own body. Otherwise, it would be impossible

132
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,440
for anyone to first say anything at a definite point in time, and for someone else to then

133
0:08:41,440 --> 0:08:45,800
be able to reply or vice versa, as neither the first nor the second speaker would be independent

134
0:08:45,800 --> 0:08:49,920
physical decision-making units any more at any time. Eliminating the prior later distinction

135
0:08:49,920 --> 0:08:53,920
then, as socialism attempts to do, is tantamount to eliminating the possibility of arguing and

136
0:08:53,920 --> 0:08:58,000
reaching agreement. However, as one cannot argue that there is no possibility for discussion

137
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,960
without the prior control of every person over his own body being recognised and accepted

138
0:09:01,960 --> 0:09:05,520
as fair, a late-comer ethic that does not wish to make this difference could never be agreed

139
0:09:05,520 --> 0:09:09,080
upon by anyone, simply saying that it could imply the contradiction, as ones being able

140
0:09:09,080 --> 0:09:12,520
to say so would presuppose one's existence as an independent decision-making unit at

141
0:09:12,520 --> 0:09:16,560
a definite point in time. Above, the homestead principle was defined as ownership as assigned

142
0:09:16,560 --> 0:09:20,520
to the initial possessor/director of any external good. This is important because

143
0:09:20,520 --> 0:09:24,400
the above analysis only works for goods which are external to the body of an acting man, and

144
0:09:24,400 --> 0:09:27,680
it assumes that there are already acting men going into nature and extracting various

145
0:09:27,680 --> 0:09:31,680
goods from it. A person's body is an entirely different type of object. There aren't bodies

146
0:09:31,680 --> 0:09:35,600
out in nature waiting for some soul to come along and homestead them. Rather, a body is

147
0:09:35,600 --> 0:09:40,240
necessarily linked to an actor. It is this objective link which imbues a man with ownership. Homesteading

148
0:09:40,240 --> 0:09:43,840
is merely one form of demonstrating this link. So how do we deal with the case of establishing

149
0:09:43,840 --> 0:09:47,400
links between acting men and the bodies used for action? Recall that property rights in

150
0:09:47,400 --> 0:09:50,840
general are conflict avoiding norms. That is to say, the very nature of ownership is

151
0:09:50,840 --> 0:09:54,480
to avoid conflicts. Recall also that this was derived from the nature of argumentation

152
0:09:54,480 --> 0:09:57,800
itself, so we can go back to argumentation to derive an assignment of property rights

153
0:09:57,800 --> 0:10:01,360
in bodies. For A and B to argue with each other, they have to first assume that the other

154
0:10:01,360 --> 0:10:05,440
guy owns himself. Imagine if A tried to argue that B is actually owned by C. Well, this

155
0:10:05,440 --> 0:10:09,000
would mean that B would be a mere mouthpiece for C, and thus A would actually be arguing

156
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,560
with C, which contradicts the presumption that A is arguing with B. Therefore, you could

157
0:10:12,560 --> 0:10:15,880
never propose that someone else is a slave without contradiction. In trying to demonstrate

158
0:10:15,880 --> 0:10:19,280
to this man that he is your or someone else's slave, you would have to first assume that

159
0:10:19,280 --> 0:10:23,080
he owns himself, then propose that you or someone else owns him, i.e. that he does

160
0:10:23,080 --> 0:10:27,000
not own himself. In other words, to engage in any argument whatsoever, you have to first

161
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:30,880
accept the validity of other men's claim to direct the use of their body. Argumentation

162
0:10:30,880 --> 0:10:34,320
becomes impossible to the degree that you reject the validity of this. Consider also

163
0:10:34,320 --> 0:10:37,880
the discussion above of the importance of property borders being objective and intersubjectively

164
0:10:37,880 --> 0:10:41,400
ascertainable. An implication of this is that particularistic norms such as A being allowed

165
0:10:41,400 --> 0:10:45,400
to a punch B, but not the other way around, are false. Similarly, an arbitrary notion

166
0:10:45,400 --> 0:10:48,800
of one group owning another group must also be discarded. This is because you have an

167
0:10:48,800 --> 0:10:53,120
objective, undeniable-and-thus-intersubjectively-ascertainable link to your own body. To

168
0:10:53,120 --> 0:10:57,120
enslave someone, the only way to control their body is indirectly via coercion, either physical

169
0:10:57,120 --> 0:11:00,720
or via threat, to get them to act how you want. In this case, the slave is still the

170
0:11:00,720 --> 0:11:04,120
one directly controlling their body, which is a superior link to the indirect one that

171
0:11:04,120 --> 0:11:07,920
the enslaver has. If arbitrarily coercing others to do what you wanted, constituted a

172
0:11:07,920 --> 0:11:11,360
greater claim over the body of the coerced person, it would be impossible to avoid conflicts

173
0:11:11,360 --> 0:11:14,800
over bodies. We would rather have a system of might-making right, which is a conflict

174
0:11:14,800 --> 0:11:19,040
authorising system of property, and thus not a rational system of property at all. The

175
0:11:19,040 --> 0:11:23,480
enslaver also contradicts himself by recognising the precedence of this link over his own body

176
0:11:23,480 --> 0:11:28,080
by using his body to coerce his slave. Moreover, any outsider who claims another's body cannot

177
0:11:28,080 --> 0:11:32,120
deny this objective link and its special status, since the outsider also necessarily

178
0:11:32,120 --> 0:11:36,520
presupposes this in his own case. This is so, because in seeking dominion over the other,

179
0:11:36,520 --> 0:11:40,760
in asserting ownership over the other's body, he has to presuppose his own ownership of his body,

180
0:11:40,760 --> 0:11:44,200
which demonstrates that he does place a certain significance on this link, at the same time

181
0:11:44,200 --> 0:11:47,760
that he disregards the significance of the other's link to his own body. Furthermore,

182
0:11:47,760 --> 0:11:51,440
we consider that a slavery ethic, i.e., an ethic which rejects self-ownership, cannot

183
0:11:51,440 --> 0:11:55,840
make for a human ethic. To be an ethic for humanity, it must satisfy two properties. First,

184
0:11:55,840 --> 0:11:59,680
it must be universal, i.e., it must apply to all humans, and second, it must actually

185
0:11:59,680 --> 0:12:03,880
ensure the survival of mankind, or else it would be an anti-human ethic, and an anti-human ethic could

186
0:12:03,880 --> 0:12:07,360
not be proposed without contradiction, as you must first presume that you should be alive

187
0:12:07,360 --> 0:12:11,400
and arguing. Rothbard has pointed out that if you do not have a system of total self-ownership,

188
0:12:11,400 --> 0:12:15,040
two possibilities remain. One, universal and equal other ownership, which he calls the

189
0:12:15,040 --> 0:12:19,360
communist ethic, or two, partial ownership of one group by another.

190
0:12:19,360 --> 0:12:22,120
Universal co-ownership fails on the grounds that it would imply the near immediate death

191
0:12:22,120 --> 0:12:26,080
of humanity, because for any person to survive they must act, and if everyone is co-owned

192
0:12:26,080 --> 0:12:29,920
by everyone, then any given person must first ask everyone else's permission before engaging

193
0:12:29,920 --> 0:12:34,080
in some action. But asking permission is itself an action. Therefore, everyone must immediately

194
0:12:34,080 --> 0:12:38,480
start doing nothing. Further, it is not strictly possible to purposefully not act. We note

195
0:12:38,480 --> 0:12:42,320
that action is defined as purposeful behaviour, so even in ceasing physical motion a man is

196
0:12:42,320 --> 0:12:47,640
acting, insofar as this ceasing is done purposefully. Therefore, this ethic simply cannot be obeyed

197
0:12:47,640 --> 0:12:52,760
no matter what a man chooses to do, as choosing any option implies action. Partial ownership

198
0:12:52,760 --> 0:12:57,000
of one group by another doesn't necessarily mean the death of humanity, but is not universal.

199
0:12:57,000 --> 0:12:59,880
Instead of being an ethic for humans, it is an ethic which implies a set of subhumans

200
0:12:59,880 --> 0:13:04,200
ruled by humans. This is thus a particularistic ethic. It is a norm of the form, one rule

201
0:13:04,200 --> 0:13:08,600
for thee, and another for me. But if the partial ownership ethic was truly rational, it must

202
0:13:08,600 --> 0:13:12,200
be able to be derived from the nature of the entities that it applies to. Thus, there would

203
0:13:12,200 --> 0:13:16,520
have to be some principled difference between the group of humans and the group of subhumans.

204
0:13:16,520 --> 0:13:19,520
We know that legal ethics are derived from argumentation, and as such they would have

205
0:13:19,520 --> 0:13:23,840
to apply to all beings which have the potential to argue. Therefore, there could be no relevant

206
0:13:23,840 --> 0:13:27,920
difference between different groups of humans with respect to law, as all humans, qua

207
0:13:27,920 --> 0:13:31,800
acting being, have the potential to engage in argumentation. One could come up with any

208
0:13:31,800 --> 0:13:35,720
number of selection criteria to split mankind up into different sets. Perhaps one wants

209
0:13:35,720 --> 0:13:40,440
to split man into different races, or nations, or into northern southern hemispheres, etc.

210
0:13:40,440 --> 0:13:44,040
The point of note here is that these different groups do not have different logics, so any

211
0:13:44,040 --> 0:13:48,560
conclusions derived that apply to arguing beings as such would have to apply to all of them.

212
0:13:48,560 --> 0:13:51,800
Now that we have a theory of property which accounts for both self ownership and external

213
0:13:51,800 --> 0:13:55,720
ownership, we can begin to address some implications of this theory, the first of which is that

214
0:13:55,720 --> 0:14:00,200
ownership is necessarily individual. That is, group ownership is strictly impossible.

215
0:14:00,200 --> 0:14:03,680
Consider a set of people, A through Z, who each commonly own a stick. What has been done about

216
0:14:03,680 --> 0:14:07,600
a conflict over the use of the stick between A and B? There are two possibilities, either

217
0:14:07,600 --> 0:14:12,160
A is said to be the just victor, or B is. If A, then he owns a stick, and B does not.

218
0:14:12,160 --> 0:14:16,520
If B, then he owns a stick, and A does not. But both options contradict the presumption

219
0:14:16,520 --> 0:14:20,840
that every member in the set owns the stick. Therefore, group ownership simply cannot occur.

220
0:14:20,840 --> 0:14:24,080
Allow me to go over some supposed solutions to this conundrum, the first of which is the

221
0:14:24,080 --> 0:14:28,160
democratic one. Essentially, all members within the set vote to determine who the just victor

222
0:14:28,160 --> 0:14:32,680
is. Still, any who lost the vote did not own the stick, as their desired possession was

223
0:14:32,680 --> 0:14:37,160
considered unjust. Also consider the set which consists only of A and B. What vote could

224
0:14:37,160 --> 0:14:40,560
possibly be conducted between these men which would not come out as A in favour of A and

225
0:14:40,560 --> 0:14:44,840
B in favour of B. If B voted for A or vice versa, there would be no conflict, and law

226
0:14:44,840 --> 0:14:48,280
these only those sets of situations where there is conflict rather than those where men are

227
0:14:48,280 --> 0:14:50,920
in a harmonious agreement about how things should be done.

228
0:14:50,920 --> 0:14:54,760
The next proposal for a solution comes from Roderick Long. He states, on the libertarian

229
0:14:54,760 --> 0:14:57,760
view, we have the right to the fruit of our labour, and we also have a right to what

230
0:14:57,760 --> 0:15:01,760
people freely give us. Public property can rise in both these ways. Consider a village

231
0:15:01,760 --> 0:15:05,160
near a lake. It is common for the villagers to walk down to the lake to go fishing. In

232
0:15:05,160 --> 0:15:07,760
the early days of the community, it is hard to get to the lake because of all the bushes

233
0:15:07,760 --> 0:15:12,120
and fallen branches in the way. But over time, the way is cleared and a path forms, not through

234
0:15:12,120 --> 0:15:15,600
any centrally coordinated effort, but simply as a result of all the individuals walking

235
0:15:15,600 --> 0:15:19,240
that way day after day. The cleared path is a product of labour, not any individuals

236
0:15:19,240 --> 0:15:23,280
labour, but all of them together. If one villager decided to take advantage of the now created

237
0:15:23,280 --> 0:15:27,120
path by setting up a gate and charging tools, he would be violating the collective property

238
0:15:27,120 --> 0:15:30,320
right that the villagers together have earned. Public property can also be the product of

239
0:15:30,320 --> 0:15:34,240
gift. In the 19th century England, it was common for roads to be built privately and

240
0:15:34,240 --> 0:15:38,240
then donated to the public for free use. This was done not out of altruism, but because

241
0:15:38,240 --> 0:15:42,040
the road builders owned land and businesses alongside the site of the new road, and they

242
0:15:42,040 --> 0:15:45,520
knew that having a road there would increase the value of their land and attract more customers

243
0:15:45,520 --> 0:15:49,640
to their business. Thus, the unorganized public can legitimately come to own land, both through

244
0:15:49,640 --> 0:15:54,200
original acquisition, the mixing of labour, and through voluntary transfer. So, Long provides

245
0:15:54,200 --> 0:15:58,320
two cases that he sees as legitimate group property; (1) where a group communally mix

246
0:15:58,320 --> 0:16:02,480
their labour with an object in nature, and (2) where a man transfers ownership of his private

247
0:16:02,480 --> 0:16:06,440
property to group in common. The issue with (1) is that Long relies on the faulty labour

248
0:16:06,440 --> 0:16:10,560
theory of property. It is not mixing labour with land which imbues a man with ownership,

249
0:16:10,560 --> 0:16:14,040
as we have seen, is the nature of scarcity giving rise to potential for conflict which

250
0:16:14,040 --> 0:16:17,280
implies property rights. To demonstrate the failure of this theory more thoroughly, allow

251
0:16:17,280 --> 0:16:21,440
me to quote Kinsella at length. As noted before, some libertarian IP advocates, such

252
0:16:21,440 --> 0:16:24,840
as Rand, hold that creation is the source of property rights. This confuses the nature

253
0:16:24,840 --> 0:16:28,360
and reasons for property rights which lie in the undeniable fact of scarcity. Given scarcity

254
0:16:28,360 --> 0:16:31,880
and the corresponding possibility of conflict in the use of resources, conflicts are avoided

255
0:16:31,880 --> 0:16:35,560
and piecing cooperation are achieved by allocating property rights to such resources.

256
0:16:35,560 --> 0:16:38,680
And the purpose of property rights dictates the nature of such rules. For if the rules

257
0:16:38,680 --> 0:16:42,000
allocating property rights are to serve as objective rules that all can agree upon so

258
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,880
as to avoid conflict, they cannot be biased or arbitrary. For this reason, unknown resources

259
0:16:45,880 --> 0:16:50,160
come to be owned, homesteaded or appropriated, by the first possessor. The general rule then

260
0:16:50,160 --> 0:16:53,520
is that ownership of a given scarce resource can be identified by determining who first

261
0:16:53,520 --> 0:16:57,160
occupied it. There are various ways to possess or occupy resources, and differing ways to

262
0:16:57,160 --> 0:17:00,360
demonstrate or prove such occupation, depending on the nature of the resource and the use to

263
0:17:00,360 --> 0:17:03,720
which it is put. Thus I can pluck an apple from the wild and thereby homestead it, or

264
0:17:03,720 --> 0:17:07,360
I can fence in a plot of land for a farm. It is sometimes said that one form of occupation

265
0:17:07,360 --> 0:17:11,280
is forming or creating the thing. For example, I can sculpt the statue from block of marble,

266
0:17:11,280 --> 0:17:15,280
or forge a sword from raw metal, or even create a farm on a plot of land. We can see from

267
0:17:15,280 --> 0:17:18,320
these examples that creation is relevant to the question of ownership of a given created

268
0:17:18,320 --> 0:17:21,760
scarce resource such as a statue, sword or farm, only to the extent that the act of

269
0:17:21,760 --> 0:17:26,360
creation is an act of occupation, or is otherwise evidence of first occupation. However, creation

270
0:17:26,360 --> 0:17:30,320
itself does not justify ownership in things, it is neither necessary nor sufficient. One

271
0:17:30,320 --> 0:17:33,800
cannot create some possibly disputed scarce resource without first using the raw materials

272
0:17:33,800 --> 0:17:37,760
used to create the item. But these raw materials are scarce, and either I own them or I do not.

273
0:17:37,760 --> 0:17:41,840
If not, then I do not own the resulting product. If I own the inputs, then by virtue of such

274
0:17:41,840 --> 0:17:45,240
ownership, I own the resulting thing into which I transform them. Consider the forging of

275
0:17:45,240 --> 0:17:49,120
a sword. If I own some raw metal, because I mined it from ground I owned, then I own

276
0:17:49,120 --> 0:17:52,520
the same metal after I have shaped it into a sword. I do not need to rely on the fact

277
0:17:52,520 --> 0:17:55,760
of creation to own the sword, but only on my ownership of the factors used to make the

278
0:17:55,760 --> 0:17:59,120
sword. And I do not need creation to come to own the factors, since I can homestead them

279
0:17:59,120 --> 0:18:02,480
simply by mining them from the ground and thereby becoming the first possessor. On the

280
0:18:02,480 --> 0:18:06,080
other hand, if I fashion a sword using your metal, I do not own the resulting sword. In

281
0:18:06,080 --> 0:18:09,080
fact, I may owe you damages for trespass or conversion.

282
0:18:09,080 --> 0:18:12,360
Long's second case, where a man transfers title to his property to some group, fails on the

283
0:18:12,360 --> 0:18:17,240
grounds that it does not resolve the contradiction, therefore making that contract invalid. Contract

284
0:18:17,240 --> 0:18:20,360
theory will be elucidated thoroughly in a future lesson, so I will not explain this

285
0:18:20,360 --> 0:18:24,360
point too deeply here. Just note that it will be seen that contract theory arises from

286
0:18:24,360 --> 0:18:27,600
property theory, and therefore you cannot have contracts which allow for contradictory

287
0:18:27,600 --> 0:18:31,920
property claims. Long is essentially putting the cart before the horse. A further potential

288
0:18:31,920 --> 0:18:35,800
solution for group property rights is the polycentrist solution. To the polycentrist, law

289
0:18:35,800 --> 0:18:39,680
in a libertarian society is decided by reference to competing arbitrators, these judges could

290
0:18:39,680 --> 0:18:43,880
settle disputes, and thus determine the arrangement of property. So for our example of A through

291
0:18:43,880 --> 0:18:47,280
Z all collectively on the stick, they would simply have to go to some judge to decide

292
0:18:47,280 --> 0:18:50,640
who has just possession. The problem with this is that it is confused about the nature

293
0:18:50,640 --> 0:18:55,040
of law, justice cannot be decreed by man, rather it depends on the normative structure

294
0:18:55,040 --> 0:18:59,560
of argumentation. And second, the contradiction is still not resolved. If this judge rules

295
0:18:59,560 --> 0:19:04,200
in favour of A, B did not own the stick, and vice versa. Companies are often forwarded as a

296
0:19:04,200 --> 0:19:07,920
counter example to this thesis. It is said that multiple people can come together to own

297
0:19:07,920 --> 0:19:12,080
shares in a given enterprise, and thus communally own said enterprise. This counter example

298
0:19:12,080 --> 0:19:15,720
is confused about what a company is. Men do not go out into nature and find companies

299
0:19:15,720 --> 0:19:19,720
which they then homestead, rather companies are specific relationships between men. They

300
0:19:19,720 --> 0:19:24,400
are constructed via a web of contracts. Just as a person cannot own friendship or marriage,

301
0:19:24,400 --> 0:19:28,520
they cannot own a firm, not legally at least. The specific property being directed by the

302
0:19:28,520 --> 0:19:32,840
company must be owned by a single individual, perhaps the CEO or another such person. This

303
0:19:32,840 --> 0:19:36,200
does not mean that the CEO can do whatever he wishes with his property. It may be the

304
0:19:36,200 --> 0:19:39,440
case that there is a contract such that if he uses a property for purposes contrary to

305
0:19:39,440 --> 0:19:43,280
the shareholders' voted upon goal, then the title of that property is transferred to some

306
0:19:43,280 --> 0:19:47,440
other person who then becomes the CEO. Nowhere in such a conception is any property owned

307
0:19:47,440 --> 0:19:50,840
by multiple people. There is a potential conundrum for this theory of homesteading, which goes

308
0:19:50,840 --> 0:19:55,760
as follows. There are three sections of land, A, B and C, as pictured. Crusoe comes along

309
0:19:55,760 --> 0:19:59,920
in homesteads A, Friday currently resides somewhere in C. Because Crusoe does not own

310
0:19:59,920 --> 0:20:04,360
B, Friday does not have a duty towards Crusoe to not enter it. And because Crusoe does

311
0:20:04,360 --> 0:20:08,600
own A, Friday does have a duty to Crusoe not to enter A. So Friday is allowed to enter

312
0:20:08,600 --> 0:20:13,360
B, but not A. However, due to the donut shape of Crusoe's homestead, to enter B implies

313
0:20:13,360 --> 0:20:17,760
entering A. Hence a contradiction arises, Friday both has a duty not to enter B and he

314
0:20:17,760 --> 0:20:21,160
does not have said duty. That is to say, Crusoe is acting like he is the owner of B

315
0:20:21,160 --> 0:20:24,840
when he is in fact not. This is called forestalling. The proposed solution put forth

316
0:20:24,840 --> 0:20:29,040
by those in the Walter Block camp is the Blockean proviso. Essentially, they claim that the contradiction

317
0:20:29,040 --> 0:20:32,920
arises from assuming that Crusoe has indeed homesteaded all of A. Therefore, to resolve

318
0:20:32,920 --> 0:20:36,920
the contradiction, these donut homesteads must be disallowed. This formulation provided by

319
0:20:36,920 --> 0:20:40,880
Łukasz Dominiak resolves a counter-argument made by Kinsella, where he imagines that the

320
0:20:40,880 --> 0:20:45,160
donut is not owned by Crusoe himself, but by 100 Crusoes, we can call Crusoe 1 through

321
0:20:45,160 --> 0:20:49,480
to Crusoe 100, which of these individual segments does Friday have the right to cross over,

322
0:20:49,480 --> 0:20:53,320
and why not any of the others? Surely if they each sequentially homesteaded their individual

323
0:20:53,320 --> 0:20:57,200
segments, none of them are individually forestalling. The solution to this is that it is Crusoe

324
0:20:57,200 --> 0:21:01,080
100 who seals up the donut who has committed the crime, as he was not able to homestead

325
0:21:01,080 --> 0:21:04,640
that final section. However, there is a way to resolve this contradiction without any

326
0:21:04,640 --> 0:21:08,600
need for a proviso. As Kinsella writes in defence of embordering-as-homesteading, utilising

327
0:21:08,600 --> 0:21:12,880
de Jasay's "let exclusion stand" principle. In a nutshell, de Jasay equates property with

328
0:21:12,880 --> 0:21:17,200
its owners excluding others from using it, for example by fencing an immovable property,

329
0:21:17,200 --> 0:21:22,320
e.g. land, or finding and creating and keeping movable property. Thus, the principle means

330
0:21:22,320 --> 0:21:26,680
let ownership stand, e.g. that claims to ownership of property, appropriated from the state of

331
0:21:26,680 --> 0:21:30,720
nature are acquired ultimately through a chain of titles tracing back to such an appropriation,

332
0:21:30,720 --> 0:21:34,880
should be respected. daisie utilises this idea to demolish the criticism that homesteading

333
0:21:34,880 --> 0:21:39,320
unowned resources unilaterally and unjustifiably imposes on others moral duties to refrain

334
0:21:39,320 --> 0:21:42,840
from interfering. I.e. it is the very nature of property that the owner excludes others

335
0:21:42,840 --> 0:21:46,160
from using it. We can then say that Crusoe in excluding others from this previously unowned

336
0:21:46,160 --> 0:21:51,520
territory, B, thereby becomes its owner. It is this act of exclusion which is Crusoe initially

337
0:21:51,520 --> 0:21:55,960
directing the use of both the donut and the donut-hole. This idea of "let exclusion stand"

338
0:21:55,960 --> 0:21:59,400
sheds light also on the falsehood of the notion that property rights must be limited because

339
0:21:59,400 --> 0:22:02,880
if they are not, I would be permitted to use my gun to shoot an innocent man. This

340
0:22:02,880 --> 0:22:05,680
is false because my property right in that gun does not mean that I am allowed to use

341
0:22:05,680 --> 0:22:09,040
that gun for whatever I want. It means that I have a right to exclude people from using

342
0:22:09,040 --> 0:22:12,840
the gun for what they want. This isn't particularly surprising either. I would also not be permitted

343
0:22:12,840 --> 0:22:16,040
to use a stolen gun to shoot someone. Who owns the gun being used for the shooting isn't

344
0:22:16,040 --> 0:22:20,080
relevant to the question of whether the shooting is just or not. Kinsella goes on. Note that

345
0:22:20,080 --> 0:22:24,120
the de Jasayan idea of let exclusion stand, or the Hoppean idea that the prior letter distinction

346
0:22:24,120 --> 0:22:28,080
is of crucial importance, also sheds light on the nature of homesteading itself. Often

347
0:22:28,080 --> 0:22:31,800
the question is asked, as to what types of acts constitute our sufficient for homesteading,

348
0:22:31,800 --> 0:22:35,400
or in bordering its hopper sometimes refers to it. What type of labour must be mixed with

349
0:22:35,400 --> 0:22:40,160
a thing, and to what property does the homesteading extend? What counts as sufficient homesteading,

350
0:22:40,160 --> 0:22:43,960
etc. And we can see that in a way the answer to these questions is related to the issue

351
0:22:43,960 --> 0:22:47,680
of what the thing is in dispute. In other words, if B claims ownership of a thing possessed

352
0:22:47,680 --> 0:22:51,640
or formally possessed by A, then the very framing of this dispute helps to identify what the

353
0:22:51,640 --> 0:22:56,000
thing is, and what counts as a possession of it. If B claims ownership of a given resource,

354
0:22:56,000 --> 0:22:59,440
he must want the right to control it according to its nature. Then the question comes, did

355
0:22:59,440 --> 0:23:03,160
someone else previously control it, according to its nature? I.e. did someone else already

356
0:23:03,160 --> 0:23:07,000
homesteaded, so that B is only a latecomer. This ties in with day you say is a let exclusion

357
0:23:07,000 --> 0:23:10,960
stand principle, which rests on the idea that if someone is actually able to control a resource,

358
0:23:10,960 --> 0:23:15,120
such that others are excluded, then this exclusion should stand. Of course, the physical nature

359
0:23:15,120 --> 0:23:18,680
of a given scarce resource, and the way in which humans use such resources, will determine

360
0:23:18,680 --> 0:23:21,640
the nature of actions needed to control it and exclude others.

361
0:23:21,640 --> 0:23:25,880
DSA, as a matter of fact, considers two basic types of appropriation, finding and keeping,

362
0:23:25,880 --> 0:23:29,640
and enclosure. The former applies primarily to movable objects that may be found, taken

363
0:23:29,640 --> 0:23:33,680
and hidden, or used exclusively. Since the thing has no prior owner, prima facia, no one

364
0:23:33,680 --> 0:23:37,680
isn't entitled to object to first possess or claiming ownership. For immovable property,

365
0:23:37,680 --> 0:23:42,720
land, possession is taken by enclosing the land, and incurring exclusion costs, e.g. erecting

366
0:23:42,720 --> 0:23:46,920
importance. Again, similar to Hoppe's embroidering, establishing an objective, intersubjectively

367
0:23:46,920 --> 0:23:50,840
as obtainable border. As, in the case with movables, others lost the opportunity to

368
0:23:50,840 --> 0:23:54,800
appropriate the property, does not give rise to a claim sufficient to oust the first possessor.

369
0:23:54,800 --> 0:23:58,400
If it did, it would be an ownership claim. So in the case where Friday is in C, Crusoe

370
0:23:58,400 --> 0:24:02,080
instantly becomes the owner of both A and B, after he completes his embordering. In

371
0:24:02,080 --> 0:24:05,680
the case where Friday is in B, assuming nobody else is in C, Crusoe would become the immediate

372
0:24:05,680 --> 0:24:08,960
owner of both A and C. What about the case where there are people or homesteaded

373
0:24:08,960 --> 0:24:13,040
property in both B and C? In that situation, it becomes clear that Crusoe would indeed

374
0:24:13,040 --> 0:24:17,440
be forestalling in fencing off A, as he could not become the owner of owned property on either

375
0:24:17,440 --> 0:24:21,480
side of his border. That is to say, this type of fencing off would be claiming possession,

376
0:24:21,480 --> 0:24:24,120
not of unowned land, but of the owned property of others.

377
0:24:24,120 --> 0:24:27,680
I have come to recognise a slight terminological problem regarding the definition of ownership.

378
0:24:27,680 --> 0:24:31,440
Initially for this course, I defined ownership as just possession, that is to say that A owns

379
0:24:31,440 --> 0:24:35,280
alpha if A can justify his possession of alpha. This terminology strikes him as being entirely

380
0:24:35,280 --> 0:24:38,920
reasonable on its face, and for some purposes, such as the discussion of homesteading above,

381
0:24:38,920 --> 0:24:42,000
it works perfectly fine. However, there are some issues with using just possession as

382
0:24:42,000 --> 0:24:45,400
your definition of ownership. First, how does one apply this terminology to situations

383
0:24:45,400 --> 0:24:48,760
where there is no conflict, and yet the owner of a thing is not in possession of it? Consider

384
0:24:48,760 --> 0:24:52,240
inviting your friend over to watch some TV. Your friend sits on your sofa, and thus he is engaged

385
0:24:52,240 --> 0:24:56,160
in some partial possession of the sofa, and of the sitting room. Given there is no conflict,

386
0:24:56,160 --> 0:24:58,880
could you ask your friend to leave if you no longer want him to sit there? Well, he was

387
0:24:58,880 --> 0:25:02,880
able to justify his possession of the sitting room, so did he not therefore own it? And

388
0:25:02,880 --> 0:25:05,280
if he owns it, what right have you to tell him to leave?

389
0:25:05,280 --> 0:25:08,840
This issue could be solved through some notion of antecedent vs descendant property rights,

390
0:25:08,840 --> 0:25:12,200
i.e. your property rights in the sofa, and the sitting room are antecedent to your friends

391
0:25:12,200 --> 0:25:15,320
right, and the antecedent right must prevail in a given conflict. I have no particular

392
0:25:15,320 --> 0:25:18,440
issue with others using this terminology, but it would make the wording of the above proof

393
0:25:18,440 --> 0:25:22,360
that ownership is exclusive a little bit tedious for my liking. As such in this course,

394
0:25:22,360 --> 0:25:25,680
I shall use the terminology that ownership is just direction, which is analogous to

395
0:25:25,680 --> 0:25:29,080
de Jasay's idea that ownership of a thing involves controlling it, and is also

396
0:25:29,080 --> 0:25:33,320
reminiscent of the Misesian idea of socialism being a society wherein a single will directs

397
0:25:33,320 --> 0:25:36,720
the factors of production. Furthermore, defining ownership in terms of who has the right to

398
0:25:36,720 --> 0:25:40,160
control or direct a given property will be useful in later lessons when describing the

399
0:25:40,160 --> 0:25:44,040
right to retribute and the right of guardianship as property rights. These things are scarce

400
0:25:44,040 --> 0:25:46,920
so our property theory has to cover them, but they aren't physical, so its odd to

401
0:25:46,920 --> 0:25:49,720
describe them in terms of possession. This course would be incomplete without at least

402
0:25:49,720 --> 0:25:53,120
a brief treatment of so-called intellectual property rights, though this section will

403
0:25:53,120 --> 0:25:56,560
indeed be brief as I already have an extensive video going over the topic. All that will

404
0:25:56,560 --> 0:25:59,640
be covered here is a proof that intellectual property rights are impossible, and are rather

405
0:25:59,640 --> 0:26:03,000
monopoly grants, and a brief demonstration that said intellectual monopoly grants are

406
0:26:03,000 --> 0:26:06,800
per se criminal. First, to demonstrate that intellectual property rights are strictly

407
0:26:06,800 --> 0:26:11,120
impossible, we consider the nature of property. To say that a person A has a property right

408
0:26:11,120 --> 0:26:15,800
in X is to say that A should win any conflict over the use of X. Briefly, a conflict is

409
0:26:15,800 --> 0:26:20,400
defined as contradictory actions, so if Crusoe is using a stick to spearfish and Friday comes

410
0:26:20,400 --> 0:26:24,120
along and tries to use that same stick to stoke his fire, we have a conflict. The two

411
0:26:24,120 --> 0:26:29,320
actions cannot take place simultaneously. One action excludes the other. Here we see

412
0:26:29,320 --> 0:26:33,880
that having a property right in X is necessarily exclusionary. We say that something is scarce

413
0:26:33,880 --> 0:26:38,520
if when you use it you exclude other people from being able to use it at the same time.

414
0:26:38,520 --> 0:26:43,520
The issue with so-called intellectual property is that ideas are not scarce, so you can't

415
0:26:43,520 --> 0:26:47,320
have a property right in an idea. If Crusoe finds a stick in nature and figures out how

416
0:26:47,320 --> 0:26:51,840
to use it to fish, his use of the stick excludes Friday, but his use of the idea of spearfishing

417
0:26:51,840 --> 0:26:56,120
does not exclude Friday. Friday is fully capable of finding a different stick and using it

418
0:26:56,120 --> 0:27:00,600
to spearfish at the exact same time. We notice that Friday has to find a different stick,

419
0:27:00,600 --> 0:27:05,560
but he does not have to find a different idea. One person having an idea excludes nobody

420
0:27:05,560 --> 0:27:11,600
else from having that same idea at the same time, so conflicts over ideas are simply impossible.

421
0:27:11,600 --> 0:27:15,680
Therefore, if Crusoe were to exclude other people from using his idea of spearfishing,

422
0:27:15,680 --> 0:27:19,720
he is not doing so in defence of a property right. Instead, he is criminally threatening

423
0:27:19,720 --> 0:27:24,160
and/or attacking people who want to use their own property to spearfish. If a man comes

424
0:27:24,160 --> 0:27:27,480
up with a new mouse trap design and patents it, then claims to everyone else that they are

425
0:27:27,480 --> 0:27:31,760
no longer allowed to use that same design, he is indirectly threatening them with violence

426
0:27:31,760 --> 0:27:36,640
through the use of the state. Intellectual property therefore constitutes a criminal threat,

427
0:27:36,640 --> 0:27:41,400
and crime is something to be opposed. Furthermore, to adopt a consistent intellectual property

428
0:27:41,400 --> 0:27:46,320
ethic is to accept ethical stasis. The IP ethic could be stated that any late-comer to

429
0:27:46,320 --> 0:27:51,040
an idea must first ask the first-comer to that idea permission before they may use it.

430
0:27:51,040 --> 0:27:54,840
But anyone who is not the first guy who thought of the idea of asking someone else's permission

431
0:27:54,840 --> 0:27:59,800
in order to use their idea must ask his permission in order to ask someone else's permission.

432
0:27:59,800 --> 0:28:04,120
But they must first ask his permission to ask his permission, and so on, ad infinitum.

433
0:28:04,120 --> 0:28:09,160
The IP ethic then implies the near-immediate cessation of all action, and therefore implies

434
0:28:09,160 --> 0:28:28,360
the death of humanity, so it cannot possibly make for a human ethic.
