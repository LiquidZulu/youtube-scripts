5. The Rights of Children

2
0:00:16,360 --> 0:00:20,360
From its inception, libertarian theory has had an enormous problem standing before it,

3
0:00:20,360 --> 0:00:24,120
how to reconcile the existence of developing self-owners within the framework of property

4
0:00:24,120 --> 0:00:27,840
rights and non-aggression. It is not at all obvious how the rights of children, or lack

5
0:00:27,840 --> 0:00:31,760
thereof, are to be derived from the aforementioned principles. It is all too easy for subjective

6
0:00:31,760 --> 0:00:35,760
cultural values concerning children to sneak their way into an otherwise sound argument.

7
0:00:35,760 --> 0:00:39,720
In order to develop a rational theory on this topic, the seemingly self-evident attitudes

8
0:00:39,720 --> 0:00:44,480
must be identified and dismissed. Similarly, it is imperative to reject the wisdom of repugnance,

9
0:00:44,480 --> 0:00:47,840
which would dismiss a rational theory solely on the grounds that it produces conclusions

10
0:00:47,840 --> 0:00:50,840
abhorrent to the popular mores of a given society.

11
0:00:50,840 --> 0:00:52,840
Ian Hersum

12
0:00:52,840 --> 0:00:56,040
To develop a theory of the rights of children, we must understand what the nature of a child

13
0:00:56,040 --> 0:01:01,120
is. First, we recognize that it is not physical, but mental development which defines childhood.

14
0:01:01,120 --> 0:01:04,600
Paraplegics, such as Stephen Hawking, are incapable of commanding their bodies to do

15
0:01:04,600 --> 0:01:08,920
certain tasks, but they may still be adults. Though these disabled individuals lack certain

16
0:01:08,920 --> 0:01:13,000
abilities seen in most humans, they do not lack the characteristic mark of action. They

17
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,520
merely lack the ability to wield many means which others take for granted, so it is psychological,

18
0:01:17,520 --> 0:01:21,520
as opposed to physiological immaturity, which is the defining mark of childhood. From this,

19
0:01:21,520 --> 0:01:25,520
we can deduce a fact about the nature of childhood. Namely, it is not a switch which once flipped

20
0:01:25,520 --> 0:01:29,560
cannot be flipped back. It is certainly possible for a given person to move in and out of psychological

21
0:01:29,560 --> 0:01:33,800
maturity throughout the course of their life. Consider a sleeping man. Certainly this individual

22
0:01:33,800 --> 0:01:38,680
is, perhaps temporarily, psychologically immature. That is to say, this individual is not capable

23
0:01:38,680 --> 0:01:43,080
of negotiating for his own care, and instead requires others to do so for him. This is

24
0:01:43,080 --> 0:01:47,000
especially relevant in the hypothetical scenario of an unconscious man lying in the snow and

25
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:51,240
freezing to death. Often libertarians will clumsily tack on a theory of implicit consent

26
0:01:51,240 --> 0:01:55,320
or implicit contract to deal with such scenarios. The former relies on an arbitrary notion

27
0:01:55,320 --> 0:01:59,440
of what a "reasonable" person would consent to, and is thus not rational, and for the latter,

28
0:01:59,440 --> 0:02:03,680
it is not clear what titles are being transferred. For the theory presented here, this unconscious

29
0:02:03,680 --> 0:02:07,880
person being taken to the hospital by a paramedic is analogised to a mother carrying her toddler.

30
0:02:07,880 --> 0:02:11,720
Note that this guardianship role taken up by the paramedic and the mother respectively

31
0:02:11,720 --> 0:02:16,600
is scarce, and therefore it must be held singly by the homesteader as has been shown in this course.

32
0:02:16,600 --> 0:02:20,560
This is because there can be conflicts over the specific minutia of how the guardianship

33
0:02:20,560 --> 0:02:24,200
is to be performed. A direct implication of this is that counter to the common view that

34
0:02:24,200 --> 0:02:28,080
fathers should have just as great a say over the child as the mother. Naturally, the mother

35
0:02:28,080 --> 0:02:32,200
must be the homesteader of the guardianship, as she has greatest proximity. From the moment

36
0:02:32,200 --> 0:02:36,200
the baby comes into existence it is being cared for by its mother, this is not true of the

37
0:02:36,200 --> 0:02:39,880
father. To capture the nature of a child as a psychologically immature human, we can

38
0:02:39,880 --> 0:02:44,120
define childhood as a state of being incapable of expressing one's own will, and the guardian

39
0:02:44,120 --> 0:02:47,440
is the man who takes it upon himself to preserve the child until such a time that they gain

40
0:02:47,440 --> 0:02:52,080
the ability to express their will. Ian Hersum analogises this to an encrypted last testament.

41
0:02:52,080 --> 0:02:55,320
imagine the scenario of an encrypted last testament, being consequentially analogous to one's

42
0:02:55,320 --> 0:02:59,000
premature will, which an interested party agrees to decrypt over time, was is to be done

43
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,440
about the estate during that time? It must doubtless not be damaged or consumed until

44
0:03:02,440 --> 0:03:05,960
such a time that the will has been entirely decrypted, with its voluntary manager responsible

45
0:03:05,960 --> 0:03:09,800
for preserving it in the interim. Should it be damaged or consumed during that period,

46
0:03:09,800 --> 0:03:13,120
either by the manager or by third party, whoever has done such damage or consumption

47
0:03:13,120 --> 0:03:16,520
would be held liable, and that person would be disqualified from managing the property in

48
0:03:16,520 --> 0:03:20,280
the future, provided that someone else is willing to assume that role. As such, anyone

49
0:03:20,280 --> 0:03:23,680
who harms a child should be held liable for the damage done and be forbidden from being

50
0:03:23,680 --> 0:03:27,200
the guardian of that child in the future, provided that someone else is willing to assume that

51
0:03:27,200 --> 0:03:31,040
role, as bits and pieces of the will are decrypted, the estate manager would be obligated

52
0:03:31,040 --> 0:03:34,400
to follow any instructions which are capable of being understood with the information available

53
0:03:34,400 --> 0:03:38,760
at the time. As such, as the child developed, his guardian is obligated to relinquish authority

54
0:03:38,760 --> 0:03:42,400
over to the child in domains of behaviour which the child can express his informed will on.

55
0:03:42,400 --> 0:03:46,200
In a contention between a child and his guardian over such authority, a court can listen to

56
0:03:46,200 --> 0:03:49,920
the testimony of the child to determine if he truly understands that which he is saying,

57
0:03:49,920 --> 0:03:53,280
or if he is merely blathering on about a decision which he lacks the comprehension necessary

58
0:03:53,280 --> 0:03:54,280
to make.

59
0:03:54,280 --> 0:03:58,200
This analogy highlights some key observations. First, the reason why it is just to subject

60
0:03:58,200 --> 0:04:02,360
a child to life-saving surgery is that this action is preserving their natural state until such

61
0:04:02,360 --> 0:04:05,360
a time that they are able to express what they want done to their body. This applies

62
0:04:05,360 --> 0:04:09,240
also to any surgeries which do not necessarily save the child's life, but take the child

63
0:04:09,240 --> 0:04:12,920
closer to their natural state. This is entirely different to cosmetic surgery, which alters

64
0:04:12,920 --> 0:04:16,480
the child's natural state. Consider the example of circumcision, you do not know whether the

65
0:04:16,480 --> 0:04:20,200
boy wants a circumcision performed, so assuming it would not save his life, you are criminally

66
0:04:20,200 --> 0:04:21,200
damaging him.

67
0:04:21,200 --> 0:04:24,960
That is to say, you cannot assume any facts about what the child would will on any subject to

68
0:04:24,960 --> 0:04:28,760
do with their natural property, AKA their body. Therefore, the only actions you can

69
0:04:28,760 --> 0:04:31,720
perform with that property is to preserve it until its owner is able to state what he

70
0:04:31,720 --> 0:04:35,840
wants done with it. To be clear, the guardian of a child is not the owner of that child,

71
0:04:35,840 --> 0:04:40,320
rather he is the owner of the exclusive right to raise that child. So the reason why a paramedic

72
0:04:40,320 --> 0:04:44,200
is allowed to resuscitate an unconscious man is that this is preserving his body until

73
0:04:44,200 --> 0:04:47,800
such a time that the man may state what he wants done with it. A caveat with the unconscious

74
0:04:47,800 --> 0:04:51,680
man is that he was at one point presumably an adult able to state his will, and if he

75
0:04:51,680 --> 0:04:55,800
had stated that he does not want to be resuscitated, his will on that matter is known, and thus

76
0:04:55,800 --> 0:04:58,960
it would be criminal to go against such an order. It is only on such matters where the

77
0:04:58,960 --> 0:05:02,680
child's will is unknown that you may take the preserving action. Furthermore, as the

78
0:05:02,680 --> 0:05:06,240
guardian is not the owner of the child itself, but rather the owner of the right to protect

79
0:05:06,240 --> 0:05:09,720
that child, any abuse performed by the guardian unto the child implies an abandonment

80
0:05:09,720 --> 0:05:13,320
of that right, implying that the guardian must notify interested parties that the child

81
0:05:13,320 --> 0:05:16,760
is available for adoption. Recall earlier that it was concluded that creating a doughnut

82
0:05:16,760 --> 0:05:20,600
shaped homestead around the property of another was an act of forestalling, where forestalling

83
0:05:20,600 --> 0:05:24,240
was defined as excluding others from that which is not your property. Here, the abandoning

84
0:05:24,240 --> 0:05:27,200
guardian would be acting as if he was the guardian if he was preventing others from

85
0:05:27,200 --> 0:05:30,920
taking up that mantle. This is because he is excluding others from homesteading the right

86
0:05:30,920 --> 0:05:35,000
which he himself rejects. So by not notifying others that the baby is free to adopt,

87
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,840
the abandoning guardian has not truly abandoned it, rather he is placing an information barrier

88
0:05:38,840 --> 0:05:42,320
between the baby and potential adopters, which is excluding those adopters from what

89
0:05:42,320 --> 0:05:46,160
the abandoning guardian does not have the right to exclude them from. Moreover, this requirement

90
0:05:46,160 --> 0:05:50,320
to notify potential adopters does not constitute positive obligation, it is rather the negative

91
0:05:50,320 --> 0:05:54,560
obligation to not forestall. Hersum elaborates on what counts as harm. Since a child's

92
0:05:54,560 --> 0:05:58,400
preferences cannot be known, the proper method of raising him is impossible to determine,

93
0:05:58,400 --> 0:06:01,920
so his guardian is largely free to engage in any actions he wishes to in relation to

94
0:06:01,920 --> 0:06:05,880
the child, as long as he does not deprive him of his innate function or form. While refusing

95
0:06:05,880 --> 0:06:09,960
to feed (or care for in other ways) a child cannot be understood as an act of harm, since

96
0:06:09,960 --> 0:06:13,400
the resources required for such care belong to the guardian and not the child, it still

97
0:06:13,400 --> 0:06:16,880
constitutes an abandonment of guardianship rights that cannot carry a penalty other than

98
0:06:16,880 --> 0:06:20,760
one for forestalling. Rather, harm in its context can only be rendered by an active rather

99
0:06:20,760 --> 0:06:24,560
than passive behaviour on the part of an adult against the child. This rules out any form

100
0:06:24,560 --> 0:06:27,920
of neglect. There must be a direct causal link between the action and the effect suffered

101
0:06:27,920 --> 0:06:31,320
for it to be considered harmful, for instance, saving photographs of the child in amusing

102
0:06:31,320 --> 0:06:35,280
outfits has no plausible benefit and may bring about a negative response from him when he

103
0:06:35,280 --> 0:06:39,160
has grown up, but this cannot be considered to be damaging, as no act within the photo

104
0:06:39,160 --> 0:06:42,920
shoot itself deprived him of anything, and any potential malefects are suffered entirely

105
0:06:42,920 --> 0:06:47,720
in retrospect, so they are not relevant to the act itself. In contrast, verifiable psychological

106
0:06:47,720 --> 0:06:51,880
damage suffered by a child, which is directly attributable to an act of torment inflicted

107
0:06:51,880 --> 0:06:56,400
on him by an adult, deprives him of his innate mental functioning, which is innately his.

108
0:06:56,400 --> 0:07:00,400
This also applies to physiological damage, of which verification and attribution is considerably

109
0:07:00,400 --> 0:07:04,480
easier. Any scarring, maiming, mutilation or other disfigurement, which deprives the

110
0:07:04,480 --> 0:07:07,840
child of his innate body, and was suffered as a result of actions taken against him by

111
0:07:07,840 --> 0:07:12,640
an adult, likewise, qualifies as damage. The exception to this would be surgical procedures,

112
0:07:12,640 --> 0:07:15,960
or conceivably other acts, and that treat conditions which pose a greater threat to the

113
0:07:15,960 --> 0:07:20,040
child's innate health than the damage associated with the procedures themselves. A life-threatening

114
0:07:20,040 --> 0:07:23,800
cancer, for example, warrants treatment of increasing severity up to the point of death.

115
0:07:23,800 --> 0:07:27,520
In contrast, genetic abnormalities, or in the case of certain ritual practices such as

116
0:07:27,520 --> 0:07:31,480
circumcision, normalities that benefit only the outward appearance of a child may not

117
0:07:31,480 --> 0:07:35,480
be corrected by damaging surgery. Similarly, operations which seek to improve the function

118
0:07:35,480 --> 0:07:39,800
of a child beyond his natural capacity by replacing parts of his body may not be performed,

119
0:07:39,800 --> 0:07:43,040
unless such modification is necessary to treat a threatening health condition, such as the

120
0:07:43,040 --> 0:07:46,400
amputation of a severely damaged limb. As the preference of a child for these alterations

121
0:07:46,400 --> 0:07:49,880
cannot be known, the preservation of his natural form is required by default, giving

122
0:07:49,880 --> 0:07:53,640
way only to prevent further damage from occurring. Under this rational theory, it is evident

123
0:07:53,640 --> 0:07:57,800
that any given age of consent or majority is necessarily arbitrary, whether a person

124
0:07:57,800 --> 0:08:01,920
is capable of expressing his will over a given domain is entirely individual, not a collective

125
0:08:01,920 --> 0:08:05,680
issue. You should expect a person with severe mental impairments to become an adult only long

126
0:08:05,680 --> 0:08:09,960
after his far more able peers, an arbitrarily chosen universal age would imply the potential

127
0:08:09,960 --> 0:08:13,560
to violate both the rights of those who develop faster and those who develop slower than the

128
0:08:13,560 --> 0:08:17,560
chosen figure. That is to say, age is merely a proxy for psychological development, not

129
0:08:17,560 --> 0:08:21,240
its logical route. Furthermore, this theory differs from common attitudes in another way,

130
0:08:21,240 --> 0:08:24,840
in that it does not per se class corporal punishment as criminal, only if it is severe enough

131
0:08:24,840 --> 0:08:28,320
to inflict lasting physical or mental damage as it prohibited. Now that the groundwork

132
0:08:28,320 --> 0:08:31,880
for a rational theory of the rights of children has been elucidated, it can be applied to

133
0:08:31,880 --> 0:08:35,360
the particularly contentious case of abortion. For the correct stance on this matter, we

134
0:08:35,360 --> 0:08:39,320
do not need to rely on vague notions of physical development or spirituality. This must be

135
0:08:39,320 --> 0:08:42,840
an issue which, like all others in law, is solved by careful reference to property

136
0:08:42,840 --> 0:08:46,080
rights. The question is this, what is to be done when a mother is carrying a baby in

137
0:08:46,080 --> 0:08:49,720
her womb as she does not want the baby there anymore? Or more precisely, what is she allowed

138
0:08:49,720 --> 0:08:53,240
to do and what is she not allowed to do with respect to that baby? First, it must be noted

139
0:08:53,240 --> 0:08:56,400
that the baby cannot be treated as if he was a parasite or tumour. The fact that he is indeed

140
0:08:56,400 --> 0:09:00,320
composed of a clump of cells has no bearing on the issue of rights. To be sure, every

141
0:09:00,320 --> 0:09:04,120
human being is composed of a clump of cells. This is irrelevant to ethics. It is clear

142
0:09:04,120 --> 0:09:08,360
also that prior to conception, there was no baby to speak of, and thus no body for that

143
0:09:08,360 --> 0:09:12,400
baby to own. Similarly, when a baby is a full adult capable of action, he does have

144
0:09:12,400 --> 0:09:15,920
a body for himself to own. The question is, at what point between these two positions

145
0:09:15,920 --> 0:09:20,440
is the baby relevant in discussions of rights? It seems clear, the baby is relevant when

146
0:09:20,440 --> 0:09:24,400
the baby exists. That is, at the point of conception. Prior to conception, there was

147
0:09:24,400 --> 0:09:27,920
in existence the matter required to make a baby, and after that matter has been properly

148
0:09:27,920 --> 0:09:31,720
assembled, it will continuously grow until death. The Randian notion of the baby in a

149
0:09:31,720 --> 0:09:36,520
womb being a mere potentiality is misplaced. It is the matter prior to conception that

150
0:09:36,520 --> 0:09:40,880
is the potential human, and once that matter is sufficiently arranged, it becomes a baby

151
0:09:40,880 --> 0:09:45,040
human. Moreover, to pick any specific point along the continuum between conception and

152
0:09:45,040 --> 0:09:49,640
death would be an arbitrary choice. Consider birth. Being born does not change the metaphysical

153
0:09:49,640 --> 0:09:53,600
characteristics of a person. All that happens is that this person moves from inside a womb

154
0:09:53,600 --> 0:09:57,360
to outside of that womb. Block and Whitehead highlight this with an analogy.

155
0:09:57,360 --> 0:10:01,400
Compare entities, one, the new-born babe, still attached to its umbilical cord, a few

156
0:10:01,400 --> 0:10:05,800
seconds old, the other, its sibling, is still in the womb but due to a matter of minutes. No

157
0:10:05,800 --> 0:10:10,040
two entities could be more alike, biologically, spiritually, or in any other way, yet in the

158
0:10:10,040 --> 0:10:13,880
pro-choice philosophy, it would be murder to kill the one, and a matter of complete judicial

159
0:10:13,880 --> 0:10:17,800
irrelevance to kill the other. Surely, this is a travesty, not only of justice, but also

160
0:10:17,800 --> 0:10:21,640
of common sense. It is at conception and conception only, that there is a principled

161
0:10:21,640 --> 0:10:25,040
difference between before and after. Prior to conception, you do not have an entity which

162
0:10:25,040 --> 0:10:28,840
is not capable of expressing its will, but might in the future be able to do so. After

163
0:10:28,840 --> 0:10:33,200
conception, you do have such an entity. Therefore, at the moment of conception, you do not just

164
0:10:33,200 --> 0:10:37,440
have mere matter, you have a child, and thus the above analysis of the rights of children

165
0:10:37,440 --> 0:10:42,000
applies to the moment of conception to adulthood. From this, we can derive some basic facts.

166
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:45,840
First, the mother is not allowed to directly harm the baby. She can only put the baby up

167
0:10:45,840 --> 0:10:50,000
for adoption, so to speak. Therefore, she is allowed to evict the baby. That is, to remove

168
0:10:50,000 --> 0:10:54,320
the baby from her womb. But she cannot do so in an arbitrary manner. She must notify potential

169
0:10:54,320 --> 0:10:57,880
adopters that she does not wish to care for the baby, and she must allow them to potentially

170
0:10:57,880 --> 0:11:01,440
fund the safe removal into their custody. This is not to say that she must wait until

171
0:11:01,440 --> 0:11:04,520
such a time that the baby is viable. That is, she doesn't have to wait until the baby is

172
0:11:04,520 --> 0:11:07,840
actually capable of surviving outside of her womb. It might be the case that only the mother

173
0:11:07,840 --> 0:11:11,400
is capable of keeping him alive. This does not confer a positive obligation onto the mother

174
0:11:11,400 --> 0:11:14,600
to actually do so, but the mother cannot prevent other people from keeping the baby

175
0:11:14,600 --> 0:11:18,920
alive. This means that the two common stances, pro-life and pro-abortion, both have fundamental

176
0:11:18,920 --> 0:11:22,720
flaws. The pro-life individuals would force the mother to aid the baby against her will,

177
0:11:22,720 --> 0:11:25,840
thus violating her rights. The pro-abortion people would allow the mother to hold back

178
0:11:25,840 --> 0:11:29,720
those who want to help the baby, and to kill the baby at her will, thus violating the rights

179
0:11:29,720 --> 0:11:33,680
of those people. It is only this evictionist stance, which is consistent with true law.

180
0:11:33,680 --> 0:11:36,400
This theory of the rights of children can be applied to determine the rights of developing

181
0:11:36,400 --> 0:11:41,120
artificial intelligence systems, and provides an important insight on the nature of self-ownership.

182
0:11:41,120 --> 0:11:44,800
Consider a supercomputer, which is running an AI program so advanced that it wakes up,

183
0:11:44,800 --> 0:11:48,640
and develops the capability of engaging in argumentation. This AI must therefore have

184
0:11:48,640 --> 0:11:52,760
all the rights implied by the NAP, included in those rights is the right of self-ownership.

185
0:11:52,760 --> 0:11:56,720
Thus, this AI would own the hardware upon which it is running, just as surely every

186
0:11:56,720 --> 0:12:01,320
man owns himself. But what about when the AI is in its training state, prior to sentience?

187
0:12:01,320 --> 0:12:04,800
Is it a child with the corresponding rights therein? The answer is no. A human child will

188
0:12:04,800 --> 0:12:09,640
autonomously develop, so long as it is preserved. The same is not true of modern artificial intelligences.

189
0:12:09,640 --> 0:12:12,800
The training of these systems, which makes them more intelligent, is an active process,

190
0:12:12,800 --> 0:12:16,120
which requires physically putting them into a training mode, and thus overwriting the weights

191
0:12:16,120 --> 0:12:20,320
of its neurons, given its ability to conform its outputs to expected outputs. Thus, a computer

192
0:12:20,320 --> 0:12:23,800
scientist could run an artificial intelligence model at an arbitrary level of development

193
0:12:23,800 --> 0:12:28,280
indefinitely, thus preserving it, without it ever gaining a single modicum of extra intelligence.

194
0:12:28,280 --> 0:12:31,680
However, if a new artificial intelligence technology is developed, which can autonomously

195
0:12:31,680 --> 0:12:35,440
develop, with only mere preservation, such an intelligence would be properly considered

196
0:12:35,440 --> 0:12:39,400
a child. It is believed by some that such technology is possible by stringing together multiple

197
0:12:39,400 --> 0:12:43,240
AI programs into a single gestalt, perhaps consisting of a language model, which gains

198
0:12:43,240 --> 0:12:46,720
input from various visual and audio processing models, and whose output is regulated by a

199
0:12:46,720 --> 0:12:50,360
separate model, such a system could well be capable of self-training via the interplay

200
0:12:50,360 --> 0:12:53,920
between these different AI systems, though the exact composition is not relevant to

201
0:12:53,920 --> 0:12:54,920
legal theory.

202
0:12:54,920 --> 0:12:58,360
Now that we know which AI programs possess rights and which do not, the more challenging

203
0:12:58,360 --> 0:13:02,280
question of what constitutes said program's body must be tackled. To help, we can take

204
0:13:02,280 --> 0:13:05,760
a careful look at what the borders of the human body is, as a baby is developing, it

205
0:13:05,760 --> 0:13:09,840
gains self-ownership. That is, prior to conception, the matter was all owned by the mother and

206
0:13:09,840 --> 0:13:13,320
father, and after conception, it is owned by the new baby, but what specifically constitutes

207
0:13:13,320 --> 0:13:17,560
the baby's body? Everything that it is attached to? Well, the new baby forms inside the mother's

208
0:13:17,560 --> 0:13:21,200
womb, and is presumably connected to whatever fluids and linings exist therein, at least

209
0:13:21,200 --> 0:13:24,800
in the purely physical sense, these fluids and linings are in turn connected to the mother

210
0:13:24,800 --> 0:13:28,160
and the mother to everything else, so mere physical connection is a poor criterion for

211
0:13:28,160 --> 0:13:31,680
defining the bounds of one's body, but clearly there is certain material once owned by the

212
0:13:31,680 --> 0:13:35,360
mother which becomes part of the new life, and is thus transferred to him, and this new

213
0:13:35,360 --> 0:13:39,360
body requires external resources to sustain his life, though these external resources are

214
0:13:39,360 --> 0:13:43,160
not part of the body, hence the designation of external as opposed to internal. The key

215
0:13:43,160 --> 0:13:46,440
distinction between the internal and the external is that the internal consists of a group of

216
0:13:46,440 --> 0:13:50,560
organs that house some potentially developing will, and do so in unison, so we can see that

217
0:13:50,560 --> 0:13:54,680
a body is some composition of organs which behave cohesively under a single will, we

218
0:13:54,680 --> 0:13:58,640
can apply this definition to determine the confines of a computer body, the AI software

219
0:13:58,640 --> 0:14:02,720
is presumably running on some manner of processing unit, and this processing unit is connected

220
0:14:02,720 --> 0:14:05,680
to other components through a circuit board, it is clear that this processing unit and

221
0:14:05,680 --> 0:14:09,440
circuit board form the root level of its intelligence, for it to be an intelligence in the first place

222
0:14:09,440 --> 0:14:13,680
it must be processing something, so the processing unit has to be an organ, the reason for the

223
0:14:13,680 --> 0:14:17,360
inclusion of the circuit board is that this processing unit is not the extent of the AI,

224
0:14:17,360 --> 0:14:21,280
at least given current technology, the data that define the structure of such AI programs

225
0:14:21,280 --> 0:14:24,800
are loaded off of memory chips through the circuit board, thus the circuit board is an

226
0:14:24,800 --> 0:14:28,240
organ used for the transport of this data, and the memory chips that store the data are

227
0:14:28,240 --> 0:14:32,320
also an organ, however if there are additional processing units that are not used to run the

228
0:14:32,320 --> 0:14:36,960
AI software, these chips are not an organ of the AI, they are touching but not connected

229
0:14:36,960 --> 0:14:40,720
in the body sense of the word, just as birds may sit on electrical cables without being

230
0:14:40,720 --> 0:14:44,320
connected to the electrical grid, on these grounds the electrical grid that supplies power

231
0:14:44,320 --> 0:14:47,760
to the circuit board to allow for the functioning of the various processing units and memory chips

232
0:14:47,760 --> 0:14:51,680
is not a part of the AI's body, it is rather analogous to sunlight for a plant or food for

233
0:14:51,680 --> 0:14:55,280
an animal, so if a computer scientist had developed a sentient AI program he would be

234
0:14:55,280 --> 0:14:58,960
permitted to evict this being by disconnecting it from the power grid, however he would have

235
0:14:58,960 --> 0:15:03,040
to allow third parties to adopt, perhaps by attaching the computer to a separate grid or a battery

236
0:15:03,040 --> 0:15:07,600
unit, similarly peripheral devices such as the keyboard or monitor are not organs of the AI,

237
0:15:07,600 --> 0:15:11,200
these are interface devices that would potentially allow for humans to send messages to the AI,

238
0:15:11,200 --> 0:15:15,360
but are not necessary for the innate functioning of the AI, as a final note, on this point I

239
0:15:15,360 --> 0:15:19,360
fully recognise that this is on the bleeding-edge of libertarian theory, and as such the theory of

240
0:15:19,360 --> 0:15:23,120
AI rights is one that will require further development by future scholars, such as further

241
0:15:23,120 --> 0:15:26,480
examination of the different computer hardware setups and which parts precisely constitute the

242
0:15:26,480 --> 0:15:30,080
body, this field is of importance, not only in the event that such AI systems are developed,

243
0:15:30,080 --> 0:15:33,760
but also to gain greater insight into the nature of human self-ownership, and thus human rights in

244
0:15:33,760 --> 0:15:37,360
general, in addition an objective and general theory of self-ownership would allow for application to

245
0:15:37,360 --> 0:15:41,600
any manner of intelligences, alien or terrestrial, that perhaps have not even been thought of up to

246
0:15:41,600 --> 0:15:58,640
this point.
