0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:16,440
1. The nature of law

2
0:00:16,440 --> 0:00:20,600
If ethics is a normative discipline that identifies and classifies certain sets of actions as

3
0:00:20,600 --> 0:00:25,040
good or evil, right or wrong, then tort or criminal law is a subset of ethics, identifying

4
0:00:25,040 --> 0:00:28,640
certain actions as appropriate for the use of violence against them. The law says that

5
0:00:28,640 --> 0:00:32,800
action X should be illegal and therefore should be combated by the violence of the law. The

6
0:00:32,800 --> 0:00:35,920
law is a set of ought or normative propositions.

7
0:00:35,920 --> 0:00:37,400
Marry Rothbard

8
0:00:37,400 --> 0:00:41,040
To proceed with an explication of Austrian legal theory, we must first understand what

9
0:00:41,040 --> 0:00:46,640
the nature of law is. First, law is a normative standard. That is to say, law is evaluative.

10
0:00:46,640 --> 0:00:50,120
Legal theory identifies a group of criminals and a group of non-criminals, with reference

11
0:00:50,120 --> 0:00:54,400
to a norm. However, there are normative standards that law does not cover, such as the question

12
0:00:54,400 --> 0:00:58,800
of where to plant one's crops or by what standard art should be judged. That is to say, there

13
0:00:58,800 --> 0:01:03,280
may be certain norms, certain guides to action, which are not covered by law. So law cannot

14
0:01:03,280 --> 0:01:08,280
be exhaustive of evaluative philosophy. Second, we know that law deals with justice. That

15
0:01:08,280 --> 0:01:12,920
is to say, law prohibits that which is unjust and permits that which is just. What is meant

16
0:01:12,920 --> 0:01:17,760
by saying that X is just is that X can be argumentatively justified. So law is a normative

17
0:01:17,760 --> 0:01:21,160
standard which guides men to just over unjust actions.

18
0:01:21,160 --> 0:01:26,480
Third, argumentative justification is a human action, requiring the use of scarce means.

19
0:01:26,480 --> 0:01:29,840
Action is defined as purposeful behaviour. It is the implementation of some scarce means

20
0:01:29,840 --> 0:01:34,040
towards some end. Consider the example of John eating a ham sandwich to satiate his

21
0:01:34,040 --> 0:01:38,360
hunger. His end is the removal of the hunger, and his means to achieve this end is the ham

22
0:01:38,360 --> 0:01:42,800
sandwich. Of note here is that the means a man employs is necessarily scarce, which means

23
0:01:42,800 --> 0:01:47,040
that his use of it prevents others from being able to use it. Therefore, in argumentatively

24
0:01:47,040 --> 0:01:52,400
justifying anything, a man has to concern himself with scarcity. Fourth, because of scarcity,

25
0:01:52,400 --> 0:01:56,600
there is a possibility for conflicts. Conflicts are defined as contradictory actions. So if

26
0:01:56,600 --> 0:02:00,080
Crusoe and Friday are on an island, and Crusoe is trying to use a stick to spearfish at the

27
0:02:00,080 --> 0:02:03,800
same time that Friday is trying to use it to stoke his fire, we have a conflict. The

28
0:02:03,800 --> 0:02:07,760
stick is scarce, so it's use by one man, prevents the other man from using it. So only

29
0:02:07,760 --> 0:02:12,520
one action, spearfishing or stoking of the fire, is able to take place. That is to say

30
0:02:12,520 --> 0:02:16,920
that one action excludes the other. Fifth, because the possibility for conflicts exists

31
0:02:16,920 --> 0:02:21,840
and cannot be ignored in argumentative justification, any legal theory must assign exclusive property

32
0:02:21,840 --> 0:02:26,320
rights so as to determine the just winner in a given conflict. That is to say, law identifies

33
0:02:26,320 --> 0:02:30,960
which sets of people are engaged in just direction, non-criminals, and which are engaged in unjust

34
0:02:30,960 --> 0:02:35,000
direction, criminals. In other words, law couldn't assign that a given direction of

35
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:40,080
some means is both just and unjust. Here, a property right in alpha, held by A, means

36
0:02:40,080 --> 0:02:43,080
that A is the one who has the right to direct the use of alpha.

37
0:02:43,080 --> 0:02:47,040
Sixth, a position on the just winner in a conflict which is to say a position on law

38
0:02:47,040 --> 0:02:50,960
is a position on ethics. Ethics is the area of philosophy which deals in general with

39
0:02:50,960 --> 0:02:56,080
guides to man's action, i.e. what man ought do. Specifically, law is a subset of ethics which

40
0:02:56,080 --> 0:02:59,320
deals with who should have possession of what, or more specifically, who should be the one

41
0:02:59,320 --> 0:03:03,360
directing the possession of what. We can therefore define law as ethics applied to the issue

42
0:03:03,360 --> 0:03:08,200
of conflicts. This is specifically a subset of interpersonal ethics, contrasted with autistic

43
0:03:08,200 --> 0:03:12,320
ethics which deals with how the man alone should act. So ethics is made up of autistic

44
0:03:12,320 --> 0:03:16,560
and interpersonal ethics, and law is a subset of the latter, dealing not in general with

45
0:03:16,560 --> 0:03:21,160
how men should interact, but with that subset of interactions which are defined as conflicts.

46
0:03:21,160 --> 0:03:24,600
Consider what it would mean to say that law is not in fact a subset of ethics. A claims

47
0:03:24,600 --> 0:03:28,040
that he cannot justify his direction of the use of alpha, but also said that he should

48
0:03:28,040 --> 0:03:32,200
nevertheless be its director. What is meant by A claiming that he should direct alpha?

49
0:03:32,200 --> 0:03:36,200
This claim by A is in attempt to justify A's direction, which A claims that he cannot

50
0:03:36,200 --> 0:03:40,480
do, therefore A is in contradiction. We shall see shortly that contradictions are

51
0:03:40,480 --> 0:03:44,440
falsehoods, therefore meaning that it cannot be the case that A should be the director where

52
0:03:44,440 --> 0:03:49,000
said direction is unjust. So law must be a subset of ethics. There does not exist any

53
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:53,440
legal claim, which is not also a moral claim. As we have seen, law is strictly derivable

54
0:03:53,440 --> 0:03:57,680
from the nature of argumentation as a human action, employing scarce physical means, therefore

55
0:03:57,680 --> 0:04:01,120
to assert that there are multiple different legal codes is to assert that there are multiple

56
0:04:01,120 --> 0:04:06,560
different logics, which is called polylogism. Legal polylogism then is the claim that different

57
0:04:06,560 --> 0:04:10,640
men may be able to adopt different logics in their argumentative justification of a system

58
0:04:10,640 --> 0:04:15,360
of property rights. The general problem with legal polylogism is that implies contradiction.

59
0:04:15,360 --> 0:04:19,200
Because for there to be different legal codes, A through Z, A must be incompatible with every

60
0:04:19,200 --> 0:04:23,600
other legal code, B through Z, in at least one aspect, or else they would not be different,

61
0:04:23,600 --> 0:04:28,240
but the same, and we would be back to singular law. Imagine that A and B are incompatible

62
0:04:28,240 --> 0:04:33,240
on action alpha. A claims it to be just, and B claims it to be unjust. The legal polylogist

63
0:04:33,240 --> 0:04:37,800
asserts that both A and B are correct. That alpha can both be justified, and it cannot

64
0:04:37,800 --> 0:04:42,160
be justified. A contradiction. The problem here is that contradictions are false, which

65
0:04:42,160 --> 0:04:46,040
we can see from the nature of argumentation. Imagine Sally and Eric are in an argument

66
0:04:46,040 --> 0:04:49,480
over the truth of the proposition P. Eric claims that P is the case, and Sally claims

67
0:04:49,480 --> 0:04:53,200
that P is not the case. This means that Eric asserts P, and Sally asserts the negation

68
0:04:53,200 --> 0:04:56,920
of P. For Sally's case to be considered an attempted refutation of Eric, rather than

69
0:04:56,920 --> 0:05:00,960
simply speaking gibberish or telling a joke, she must presuppose that P and not P cannot

70
0:05:00,960 --> 0:05:06,240
both be correct. That is to say, in disputing anything, you presuppose the law of non-contradiction.

71
0:05:06,240 --> 0:05:10,160
The Stanford EncyclopÃ¦dia of Philosophy defines legal positivism as the thesis that the existence

72
0:05:10,160 --> 0:05:15,160
and content of law depends on social facts and not on its merits. In other words, a legal

73
0:05:15,160 --> 0:05:19,000
positivist claims that law is not a subset of ethics, and thus there could potentially

74
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:24,080
be such a thing as a virtuous crime to a legal positivist. The article elaborates. The positivist

75
0:05:24,080 --> 0:05:27,680
thesis does not say that laws merits are unintelligible, unimportant, or peripheral to the

76
0:05:27,680 --> 0:05:32,200
philosophy of law. It says that they do not determine whether laws or legal systems exist.

77
0:05:32,200 --> 0:05:36,320
Whether a society has a legal system depends on the presence of certain structures of governance,

78
0:05:36,320 --> 0:05:40,320
not on the extent to which it satisfies ideals of justice, democracy, or rule of law. What

79
0:05:40,320 --> 0:05:44,320
laws are enforced in that system depends on what social standards as officials recognise

80
0:05:44,320 --> 0:05:48,880
as authoritative. For example, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, or social

81
0:05:48,880 --> 0:05:52,800
customs. The fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is near a sufficient

82
0:05:52,800 --> 0:05:56,520
reason to thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust, unwise,

83
0:05:56,520 --> 0:06:00,880
inefficient, or imprudent, is never sufficient reason for doubting it. According to positivism,

84
0:06:00,880 --> 0:06:05,160
law is a matter of what has been posited, ordered, decided, practised, tolerated, etc.

85
0:06:05,160 --> 0:06:09,160
Law to the legal positivist then is a description of the specific arrangement of possessions

86
0:06:09,160 --> 0:06:13,200
that actually obtain, rather than a theory describing the just arrangement of possessions.

87
0:06:13,200 --> 0:06:17,040
Let's break that down. The legal positivist is making the claim that law has nothing

88
0:06:17,040 --> 0:06:22,080
to do with justice. Rather, the law is determined by raw might. That is, if A is able to physically

89
0:06:22,080 --> 0:06:26,440
defeat B in a conflict, and thus perform an action alpha, the positivist goes only as

90
0:06:26,440 --> 0:06:31,040
far as to point and say, look, A won the conflict. Therefore, the law on this conflict

91
0:06:31,040 --> 0:06:37,040
is that A won, but this is a complete non-theory. Okay, A won, so what? How on earth they think

92
0:06:37,040 --> 0:06:40,640
they get to cordon off an area of philosophy and take the label law for what can be summed

93
0:06:40,640 --> 0:06:45,040
up in the sentence, whoever wins a given conflict has won that conflict, is beyond me. The legal

94
0:06:45,040 --> 0:06:48,440
positivist as such can't even elucidate a theory predicting when people will choose

95
0:06:48,440 --> 0:06:52,040
to engage in a conflict and who is likely to win. Those would be the domains of economics

96
0:06:52,040 --> 0:06:56,760
and military theory, respectively. The problems with positivist thesis do not stop here. Even

97
0:06:56,760 --> 0:07:00,880
if a positivist were to reject the separation of law and justice, claiming that might makes

98
0:07:00,880 --> 0:07:04,760
right, their theory is still in ruin, because the might-makes-right theory of law is a form

99
0:07:04,760 --> 0:07:08,800
of legal polylogism. It is the claim that the logic of which actions are justifiable can

100
0:07:08,800 --> 0:07:12,840
change depending on whether you are able to successfully carry out that action and muscle

101
0:07:12,840 --> 0:07:18,040
away anybody who gets in the way. As we saw above, legal polylogism in general is false,

102
0:07:18,040 --> 0:07:22,240
therefore this form of legal positivism is false also. Any notion of a source of rights is

103
0:07:22,240 --> 0:07:27,080
indicative of positivism, and more fundamentally of the fallacy of primacy of consciousness.

104
0:07:27,080 --> 0:07:30,280
Rights simply are, they don't come from some consciousness, whether divine or social

105
0:07:30,280 --> 0:07:34,120
or individual. It is not arbitrary thoughts or decrees which are the source of rights,

106
0:07:34,120 --> 0:07:37,920
but the logic of justification and conflict. So we have seen that the nature of law implies

107
0:07:37,920 --> 0:07:43,040
that there must be a universal law. That is, any form of legal polylogism is necessarily

108
0:07:43,040 --> 0:07:47,680
false. And further, to argue or dispute anything would be to presuppose the existence of a single

109
0:07:47,680 --> 0:07:52,840
universal law. We can say that this universal law is therefore true law, as it is the normative

110
0:07:52,840 --> 0:07:56,880
foundation of argumentation and argumentation is a practical precondition for ascertaining

111
0:07:56,880 --> 0:08:01,360
the truth or validity of anything. Imagine attempting to dispute that this law is true.

112
0:08:01,360 --> 0:08:04,720
First you would have to accept its validity, as that validity is implied by the act of

113
0:08:04,720 --> 0:08:09,000
argumentation, so you would therefore be explicitly proclaiming it to be false, whilst implicitly

114
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:13,480
presupposing it to be true, which is a contradiction. A contradiction not between propositions,

115
0:08:13,480 --> 0:08:16,920
but between a proposition and the very act of proposing it. But there is no such thing

116
0:08:16,920 --> 0:08:21,000
as a free-floating proposition which does not come from an actor proposing it. Therefore,

117
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,880
there is an objective, natural law. It is this natural law which will be elucidated

118
0:08:24,880 --> 0:08:28,880
in this course. We understand that its nature is that it is specifically a study of human

119
0:08:28,880 --> 0:08:33,880
action. The general science of human action is called praxeology, so law is a sub-science

120
0:08:33,880 --> 0:08:38,480
of praxeology. Thus, it will be of use to briefly go over some basic praxeology here

121
0:08:38,480 --> 0:08:42,440
to make comprehension of the rest of this course easier. First, human action is purposeful

122
0:08:42,440 --> 0:08:46,560
behaviour. It is distinct from mere behaviour in that the former involves some intentional

123
0:08:46,560 --> 0:08:50,840
aiming at a goal, where the latter does not. So the operation of a man's digestive system

124
0:08:50,840 --> 0:08:54,480
or the beating of his heart can be understood as mere mechanistic behaviour, as the man does

125
0:08:54,480 --> 0:08:58,720
not intend to digest or beat his heart. And on the other hand, his choosing to eat food

126
0:08:58,720 --> 0:09:02,720
or shock himself with a defibrillator are purposeful, so these are not mere behaviours,

127
0:09:02,720 --> 0:09:06,240
but are rather actions. It is this notion of choice which is crucial to understanding

128
0:09:06,240 --> 0:09:09,680
something as an action. Action involves a deliberate attempt to change the world to one

129
0:09:09,680 --> 0:09:13,520
that man finds more preferable to the alternative where he does not engage in said action. It

130
0:09:13,520 --> 0:09:17,440
is this choice of what man prefers over the alternative, that is the characteristic mark

131
0:09:17,440 --> 0:09:21,760
of action. Therefore, for an action to be possible in the first place, (1) a man must

132
0:09:21,760 --> 0:09:26,080
experience some state of uneasiness, something that he doesn't like, (2) he must imagine

133
0:09:26,080 --> 0:09:30,240
a state of the world without this uneasiness, and (3) he must believe that a given action

134
0:09:30,240 --> 0:09:34,200
will work to achieve this imagined state without the uneasiness. When a man acts, the result

135
0:09:34,200 --> 0:09:38,360
he wishes to achieve can be called his end. Man always acts to remove uneasiness, and

136
0:09:38,360 --> 0:09:42,560
his end is the imagined state without said uneasiness. For man to achieve the end desired,

137
0:09:42,560 --> 0:09:46,920
he must employ certain means. A metaphysical entity is understood as a means when a human

138
0:09:46,920 --> 0:09:51,440
plans to employ, or is employing it for the attainment of some end. As has been shown,

139
0:09:51,440 --> 0:09:56,120
for a man to engage in an action X as opposed to not X, implies that the man prefers to engage

140
0:09:56,120 --> 0:10:00,200
in action X as opposed to not X. What this preference means is that the man thinks he

141
0:10:00,200 --> 0:10:03,320
should do X, rather the alternative for whatever reason.

142
0:10:03,320 --> 0:10:07,840
In the context of legal analysis, one important praxeological doctrine is the distinction between

143
0:10:07,840 --> 0:10:12,720
action and mere behaviour. The difference between action and behaviour boils down to intent.

144
0:10:12,720 --> 0:10:16,800
Action is an individual's intentional intervention in the physical world, via certain selected

145
0:10:16,800 --> 0:10:20,400
means, with the purpose of attaining a state of affairs that is preferable to the conditions

146
0:10:20,400 --> 0:10:23,000
that would prevail in the absence of the action.

147
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,600
Mere behaviour, by contrast, is a person's physical movements that are not undertaken

148
0:10:26,600 --> 0:10:31,200
intentionally and that do not manifest any purpose, plan, or design. In learning philosophy

149
0:10:31,200 --> 0:10:35,120
it is often of great use of the student to study the history of philosophy, such that an understanding

150
0:10:35,120 --> 0:10:39,320
of what ideas have been had and where they came from can be attained. Thus, a brief overview

151
0:10:39,320 --> 0:10:42,720
of the history of (legal) philosophy seems appropriate to include here.

152
0:10:42,720 --> 0:10:46,600
Kinsella provides such a brief overview. In modern times, the two dominant legal systems

153
0:10:46,600 --> 0:10:50,160
are the common law and the civil law, based on the body of English case law that developed

154
0:10:50,160 --> 0:10:54,360
gradually over the centuries. The common law spread to English colonies in commonwealths

155
0:10:54,360 --> 0:10:58,880
like America, Canada, and Australia. Modern civil law systems are based on Roman law,

156
0:10:58,880 --> 0:11:02,280
which, like the common law, developed many of its important legal principles in the

157
0:11:02,280 --> 0:11:06,760
accumulated decisions of jurists in thousands of cases. Virtually all of Europe and many

158
0:11:06,760 --> 0:11:11,640
other jurisdictions, including Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and Quebec, a civil law system.

159
0:11:11,640 --> 0:11:15,040
In the common law and Roman law, they're eventually evolved very sophisticated bodies

160
0:11:15,040 --> 0:11:19,440
of legal principles, concepts, methodology, and precedence. Because the classical common

161
0:11:19,440 --> 0:11:22,880
law and Roman law develop the large bulk of their legal principles through the decision

162
0:11:22,880 --> 0:11:27,000
and discussion of cases, they serve as rough examples of decentralized systems of a judge

163
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:31,920
found law, and as do largely private customary law systems like the law merchant. So broadly

164
0:11:31,920 --> 0:11:37,440
speaking, there are two types of legal systems; (1) those based on "judge-found" law, and

165
0:11:37,440 --> 0:11:41,240
(2) those where the legal principles are decreed by legislation. Roman law and English common

166
0:11:41,240 --> 0:11:45,280
law are examples of the former, where the legal principles are obtained by judges attempting

167
0:11:45,280 --> 0:11:49,240
to do justice in a number of individual cases, which is why such systems are described as

168
0:11:49,240 --> 0:11:53,760
case law systems. Modern civil law, on the other hand, is the prime example of a legislated

169
0:11:53,760 --> 0:11:57,560
system, where principles are embodied in a "Civil Code" derived from the arbitrary decree

170
0:11:57,560 --> 0:12:01,800
of the legislative branch. Under a legislative system, the judges are not attempting to do

171
0:12:01,800 --> 0:12:05,840
justice in some particular dispute, rather they make reference to the legislative fiat

172
0:12:05,840 --> 0:12:09,840
on this matter. So appealing to a judge that the given law is unjust is not going to work

173
0:12:09,840 --> 0:12:14,240
where it would in a case law system. The distinction between judge found law and law as decreed

174
0:12:14,240 --> 0:12:18,840
by legislative fiat is an important one. In a decentralized case law system, the judges

175
0:12:18,840 --> 0:12:23,520
are at least setting out to do justice. This is in stark distinction to a fiat law system,

176
0:12:23,520 --> 0:12:27,440
where the so-called laws are not rational, but rather arbitrary commandments issued top

177
0:12:27,440 --> 0:12:31,200
down by the legislature. Because these commandments are arbitrary, there is nothing objective

178
0:12:31,200 --> 0:12:35,080
about the laws in such a system. And because the laws are non-objective, but rather based

179
0:12:35,080 --> 0:12:40,160
an arbitrary subjective whim, such a system is per se incompatible with justice and freedom.

180
0:12:40,160 --> 0:12:44,680
Even statutes that seem to embody libertarian principles simultaneously subvert those principles.

181
0:12:44,680 --> 0:12:48,240
Because in such a legislative system, a victim of an objective crime cannot appeal to the

182
0:12:48,240 --> 0:12:52,560
objective principles of justice, judges can only accidentally make the right call, and

183
0:12:52,560 --> 0:12:56,560
they have no way of determining the correct compensation for the victim. In fact, most

184
0:12:56,560 --> 0:13:00,240
often compensating the victim is completely ignored. Instead, the state will charge the

185
0:13:00,240 --> 0:13:04,360
victim money in the form of taxes to punish the criminal by some one-size-fits-all punishment

186
0:13:04,360 --> 0:13:08,760
scheme, usually imprisonment. Bruno Leoni has pointed out further that fiat law systems

187
0:13:08,760 --> 0:13:12,800
will tend towards more legal uncertainty. This is because where law is determined by

188
0:13:12,800 --> 0:13:17,240
arbitrary fiat, rather than objective principles of justice, it can change at any moment. This

189
0:13:17,240 --> 0:13:20,320
has the effect of making it challenging to even begin to follow the law in the first

190
0:13:20,320 --> 0:13:23,680
place. Consider the many thousands of pages of legislation that are committed to the

191
0:13:23,680 --> 0:13:27,600
books. Professional lawyers whose job is to know the law could not hope to keep up with

192
0:13:27,600 --> 0:13:31,920
this, let alone random citizens. There's also no means of preventing contradictions

193
0:13:31,920 --> 0:13:35,520
from occurring between statutes, potentially making it literally impossible to follow the

194
0:13:35,520 --> 0:13:40,080
law, even if you know about every word of it. This is not so with a found law system,

195
0:13:40,080 --> 0:13:44,160
where there has to be coherence between different objective principles. And of course, if it's

196
0:13:44,160 --> 0:13:49,720
impossible to follow the law, then law cannot guide men's actions. So impossible fiat law

197
0:13:49,720 --> 0:13:54,560
is not law at all. To sum up, the job of the rational jurist is to explicate, discover

198
0:13:54,560 --> 0:13:58,320
objective standards of law. The role of the judge is to attempt to apply this objective

199
0:13:58,320 --> 0:14:03,200
body of law in a given case. The rational judge attempts to do justice, rather than apply

200
0:14:03,200 --> 0:14:08,200
or create, i.e. posit, arbitrary rules based on whim. This is an important insight,

201
0:14:08,200 --> 0:14:12,200
those in the David Friedman camp, called polycentrists, view an anarcho-capitalist legal

202
0:14:12,200 --> 0:14:17,200
order as one of multi-legislation, multi-centralized law, rather than decentralized judge found

203
0:14:17,200 --> 0:14:22,400
law. The free market judge is not a mini-legislator, coming up with arbitrary decrees. He is and

204
0:14:22,400 --> 0:14:27,120
must be attempting to apply objective legal principles. We can, from the armchair, explicate

205
0:14:27,120 --> 0:14:31,160
such an objective body of law. What we cannot do is actually elaborate every possible case

206
0:14:31,160 --> 0:14:35,320
that might come up. This is the role of the judge, to attempt to apply abstract and objective

207
0:14:35,320 --> 0:14:48,320
principles to concrete cases.
