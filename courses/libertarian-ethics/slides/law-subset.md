# 7. An Elaboration on the Nature of Law as a Subset of Ethics

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> [...] value is objective (not intrinsic or subjective); value is based on and derives from the facts of reality (it does not derive from mystic authority or from whim, personal or social). Reality, we hold — along with the decision to remain in it, i.e., to stay alive — dictates and demands an entire code of values. Unlike the lower species, man does not pursue the proper values automatically; he must discover and choose them; but this does not imply subjectivism.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> Every proper value-judgment is the identification of a fact: a given object or action advances man’s life (it is good): or it threatens man’s life (it is bad or an evil). The good, therefore, is a species of the true; it is a form of recognizing reality. The evil is a species of the false; it is a form of contradicting reality. Or: values are a type of facts; they are facts considered in relation to the choice to live.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> [...] Existentially, an action of man [...] is good or bad according to its effects: its effects, positive or negative, on man’s life. Thus creating a skyscraper is good, murdering the architect is bad — both by the standard of life. But human action is not merely physical motion; it is a product of a man’s ideas and value-judgments, true or false, which themselves derive from a certain kind of mental cause; ultimately, from thought or from evasion.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> [...] The skyscraper’s creator [...] functioned on the basis of proper value-judgments and true ideas, including a complex specialized knowledge; so he must have expended mental effort, focus, work; so one praises him morally and admires him. But the murderer [...] acted on ideas and value-judgments that defy reality; so he must have evaded and practiced whim-worship; so one condemns him morally and despises him.

# Agaisnt the Separation of Ethics and Law

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> It is often contended that the existence of extreme, or "lifeboat," situations disproves any theory of absolute property rights, or indeed of any absolute rights of self-ownership whatsoever. It is claimed that since any theory of individual rights seems to break down or works unsatisfactorily in such fortunately rare situations, therefore there can be no concept of inviolable rights at all.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> In a typical lifeboat situation, there are, let us say, eight places in a lifeboat putting out from a sinking ship, and there are more than eight people wishing to be saved. Who then is to decide who should be saved and who should die?

---

## The Lifeboat Situation

---

## The Lifeboat Situation
 * Only 8 spots, more than 8 people, therefore there must be property rights in the spaces
 * Owner gets the say
 * If there are no rules set the homesteading principle applies

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> If the owner of the boat or his representative (e. g. the captain of the ship) has died in the wreck, and if he has not laid down known rules in advance of the wreck for allocation of seats in such a crisis, then the lifeboat may be considered–at least temporarily for the emergency–abandoned and therefore unowned. At this point, our rules for unowned property come into play: namely, that unowned resources become the property of the first people possessing them.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> In short, the first eight people to reach the boat are, in our theory, the proper "owners" and users of the boat. Anyone who throws them out of the boat then commits an act of aggression in violating the property right of the "homesteader" he throws out of the boat. After he returns to shore, then, the aggressor becomes liable for prosecution for his act of violation of property right (as well, perhaps, for murder of the person he ejected from the boat).

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> In the first place, a lifeboat situation is hardly a valid test of a theory of rights, or of any moral theory whatsoever. Problems of a moral theory in such an extreme situation do not invalidate a theory for normal situations. In any sphere of moral theory, we are trying to frame an ethic for man, based on his nature and the nature of the world-and this precisely means for normal nature, for the way life usually is, and not for rare and abnormal situations.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> It is a wise maxim of the law, for precisely this reason, that "hard cases make bad law." We are trying to frame an ethic for the way men generally live in the world; we are not, after all, interested in framing an ethic that focuses on situations that are rare, extreme, and not generally encountered.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> Let us take an example, to illustrate our point, outside the sphere of property rights or rights in general, and within the sphere of ordinary ethical values. Most people would concede the principle that "it is ethical for a parent to save his child from drowning." But, then, our lifeboat skeptic could arise and hurl this challenge: "Aha, but suppose that two of your children are drowning and you can save only one. Which child would you choose?

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> And doesn't the fact that you would have to let one child die negate the very moral principle that you should save your drowning child?" I doubt whether many ethicists would throw over the moral desirability or principle of saving one's child because it could not be fully applied in such a "lifeboat" situation. Yet why should the lifeboat case be different in the sphere of rights?

## Againt Multi-Sphere Ethics

## The Drowning Children Hypothetical

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> It may well be objected to our theory as follows: that a theory of property rights or even of self-ownership is derivable from the conditions by which man survives and flourishes in this world, and that therefore in this kind of extreme situation, where a man is faced with the choice of either saving himself or violating the property rights of the lifeboat owner (or, in the above example, of the "homesteader" in the boat), it is then ridiculous to expect him to surrender his life on behalf of the abstract principle of property rights.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> Because of this kind of consideration, many libertarians who otherwise believe in property rights gravely weaken them on behalf of the "contextualist" contention that, given a choice between his life and aggressing against someone else's property or even life, it is moral for him to commit the aggression and that therefore in such a situation, these property rights cease to exist.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> _**The error here on the part of the "contextualist" libertarians is to confuse the question of the moral course of action for the person in such a tragic situation with the totally separate question of whether or not his seizing of lifeboat or plank space by force constitutes an invasion of someone else's property right.**_ For we are not, in constructing a theory of liberty and property, i.e., a "political" ethic, concerned with all personal moral principles.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> We are not herewith concerned whether it is moral or immoral for someone to lie, to be a good person, to develop his faculties, or be kind or mean to his neighbors. We are concerned, in this sort of discussion, solely with such "political ethical" questions as the proper role of violence, the sphere of rights, or the definitions of criminality and aggression.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> Whether or not it is moral or immoral for "Smith"–the fellow excluded by the owner from the plank or the lifeboat–to force someone else out of the lifeboat, or whether he should die heroically instead, is not our concern, and not the proper concern of a theory of political ethics.

---

## Rothbard the Contextualist?

---

## Rothbard the Contextualist?
 * If law was not a subset of ethics it would make no sense to analogise legal values to *ordinary* ethical values
 * Rothbard is correct that "we are not, in constructing a theory of liberty and property [...] concerned with **all** personal moral principles"
 * Nowhere does Rothbard directly endorse a separation of law and ethics

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> Eric Mack's example fails to show a necessary conflict between property rights and moral principles. The conflict in his example is between property rights and the dictates of prudence or self-interest. But the latter is only dominant in morality if one adopts moral egoism, which indeed Professor Mack does, but which is only one possible moral theory.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> The crucial point is that *even* if the contextualist libertarian may say that, given the tragic context, Smith *should* throw someone else out of the lifeboat to save his own life, he is *still* committing, at the very least, invasion of property rights, and probably also murder of the person thrown out.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> So that even if one says that he should try to save his life by forcibly grabbing a seat in the lifeboat, he is still, in our view, liable to prosecution as a criminal invader of property right, and perhaps as a murderer as well. After he is convicted, it would be the *right* of the lifeboat owner or the heir of the person tossed out to forgive Smith, to pardon him because of the unusual circumstances; but it would also be their right *not* to pardon and to proceed with the full force of their legal right to punish.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> Once again, we are concerned in this theory with the rights of the case, *not* with whether or not a person chooses voluntarily to exercise his rights. In our view, the property owner or the heir of the killed would have a right to prosecute and to exact proper punishment upon the aggressor.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray N. Rothbard (1982), *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> The fallacy of the contextualists is to confuse considerations of individual, personal morality (what should Smith do?) with the question of the rights of the case. The right of property continues, then, to be absolute, even in the tragic lifeboat situation.

## Contextualism as Polylogism

---

<!-- _footer: Konrad Graf (2011), *Action-Based Jurisprudence: Praxeological Legal Theory in Relation to Economic Theory* -->

> Placing deductive legal theory within praxeology enables its reconstruction as a categorical and definitional assessment of what types of actions are NAP infringements—separate from moral assessment of such infringements. In this view, an example of an ethical statement would be, "One should not violate rights." Legal theory helps to make this goal actionable by supplying information concerning the question: "What is 'violating rights?'"

---

## The Meaning of Justification

---

<!-- _footer: Konrad Graf (2011), *Action-Based Jurisprudence: Praxeological Legal Theory in Relation to Economic Theory* -->

> There *is* an intuitive relationship between law and ethics. However, I argue that it is not one of a field to a sub-field, but rather an *advisory* relationship between two distinct fields. [...] If one takes on the moral objective of not aggressing, one is more likely to be *successful* at this in action with a clear idea of what aggression is. "Rights infringements" become one category of wrongs next to other non-legal categories of wrongs that a given ethical system may specify.

---

<!-- _footer: Konrad Graf (2011), *Action-Based Jurisprudence: Praxeological Legal Theory in Relation to Economic Theory* -->

> Yet the definition of *what constitutes* infringing rights is derived independently of ethics using the categorical, counterfactual method of praxeology. Although [Argumentation Ethics] establishes that no propositional argument against the NAP can succeed, it does not prevent human beings from infringing the NAP *anyway*.

---

## Aggression as an Error
 * Aggression being evil doesn't prevent aggression the same as 1+1=2 doesn't prevent people from acting on the information that it is 3
 * Any norm that contradicts with the NAP is incoherent
 * Law is pointless if it is not a subset of ethics
 * Could one accept the NAP whilst agreeing entirely with the Marxists?

---

<!-- _footer: Hans-Hermann Hoppe (2005), *The Economics and Ethics of Private Property* -->

> [T]he praxeological proof of libertarianism has the advantage of offering a completely value-free justification of private property. It remains entirely in the realm of is-statements and never tries to derive an "ought" from an "is." The structure of the argument is this: (a) justification is propositional justification—a priori true is-statement; (b) argumentation presupposes property in one's body and the homesteading principle—a priori true is-statement; and (c) then, no deviation from this ethic can be argumentatively justified—a priori true is-statement.

---

<!-- _footer: Hans-Hermann Hoppe (2005), *The Economics and Ethics of Private Property* -->

> The proof also offers a key to an understanding of the nature of the fact-value dichotomy: Ought-statements cannot be derived from is-statements. They belong to different logical realms. It is also clear, however, that one cannot even state that there are facts and values if no propositional exchanges exist, and that this practice of propositional exchanges in turn presupposes the acceptance of the private property ethic as valid.

---

<!-- _footer: Hans-Hermann Hoppe (2005), *The Economics and Ethics of Private Property* -->

> In other words, cognition and truth-seeking as such have a normative foundation, and the normative foundation on which cognition and truth rest is the recognition of private property rights.

---

## The Quote Proves Nothing

---

1. I ought engage in aggression $X \longrightarrow p\wedge\neg p$ (a priori true is-statement);
2. $\neg(p\wedge\neg p)$ (a priori true is-statement);
3. $\therefore$ I ought *not* engage in aggression $X$ (a priori true ought-statement).

---

$\neg\text{NAP}\longrightarrow p\wedge\neg p\ \therefore \neg(\neg\text{NAP})=\text{NAP}$

## Values as Objective

---

## Values as Objective
 * Insofar as a person is engaging in any form of evaluation or acting at all he is making the choice of existence (life) over non-existence (death). So life is an objective value
 * Anti-life means anti-existence which means anti-reality, this is an incoherent position
 * To think is moral, to evade is immoral

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> In the objective approach, since every fact bears on the choice to live, every truth necessarily entails a value-judgment, and every value-judgment necessarily presupposes a truth. As Ayn Rand states the point in “The Objectivist Ethics”: “Knowledge, for any conscious organism, is the means of survival; to a living consciousness, every ‘is‘ implies an ‘ought.'”

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> Evaluation, accordingly, is not a compartmentalized function applicable only to some aspects of man’s life or of reality; if one chooses to live and to be objective, a process of evaluation is coextensive with and implicit in every act of cognition.

---

## The Moral Implications of Facts

## The Moral Implications of Facts
 * Metaphysically given facts have a bearing on mans self-preservation
 * That the sun shines implies that you ought grow crops in the shine rather than the shade
 * "All these evaluations are demanded by the cognitions involved [...]."<sup>11</sup>

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> [...] If the conscientious attempt to perceive reality by the use of one’s mind is the essence of honesty, no such rebellion can qualify as “honest.”

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> The originators, leaders and intellectual spokesmen of all such movements are necessarily evaders on a major scale; they are not merely mistaken, but are crusading irrationalists. The mass base of such movements are not evaders of the same kind; but most of the followers are dishonest in their own passive way. They are unthinking, intellectually irresponsible ballast, unconcerned with logic or truth.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> They go along with corrupt trend-setters because their neighbors demand it, and/or because a given notion satisfies some out-of-context desire they happen to feel. People of this kind are not the helplessly ignorant, but the willfully self-deluded.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> **EVEN IN REGARD** to inherently dishonest movements, let me now add, a marginal third category of adherent is possible: the relatively small number who struggle conscientiously, but simply cannot grasp the issues and the monumental corruption involved. These are the handful who become Communists, “channelers,” etc. through a truly honest error of knowledge.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> Leaving aside the retarded and the illiterate, who are effectively helpless in such matters, this third group consists almost exclusively of the very young — and precisely for this reason, these youngsters get out of such movements fast, on their own, without needing lectures from others; they get out as they reach maturity. Being conscientious and mentally active, they see first-hand what is going on in their movement and they identify what it means; so their initial enthusiasm turns to dismay and then to horror. (Andrei in *We the Living* may be taken as a fictional symbol here.)

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> The very honesty of such individuals limits their stay in the movement; they cannot tolerate for long the massiveness of the evil with which they have become involved. Nor, when such youngsters drop out, do they say to the world belligerently: “Don’t dare to judge me for my past, because my error was honest.”

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> On the contrary — and here I speak from my own personal experience of honest errors that I committed as a teenager — the best among these young people are contrite; they recognize the aid and comfort, inadvertent though it be, which they have been giving to error and evil, and they seek to make amends for it.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> They expect those who know of their past creeds and allegiances to regard them with suspicion; they know that it is their own responsibility to demonstrate *objectively* and across time that they have changed, that they will not repeat their error tomorrow in another variant, that their error was innocent.

> [...] To an individual in a division-of-labor society, it makes a life-or-death difference whether he is surrounded by producers or parasites, honest men or cheats, independent men or power-lusters. Just as one must distinguish between good and bad in relation to the realm of nature, so one must distinguish between good and bad in relation to the realm of man.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> In Objectivist terms, this means a single fundamental issue: in the human realm, one must distinguish the rational from the irrational, the thinkers from the evaders. Such judgment tells one whether a man, in principle, is committed to reality — or to escaping from and fighting it.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> In the one case, he is an ally and potential benefactor of the living; in the other, an enemy and potential destroyer. Thus the mandate of justice: identify the good (the rational) and the evil (the irrational) in men and their works — then, first, deal with, support and/or reward the good; and, second, boycott, condemn and/or punish the evil.

---

## Proper Moral Evaluation

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> Implicit in saying that a certain idea is true is a positive moral estimate of the mental processes that led to it (a credit to the individual for having worked to grasp reality), *and* a positive estimate of the existential results to come (a true idea will have to yield pro-life results when men act on it). The same applies *mutatis mutandis* to false ideas.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> Implicit in saying that an idea contradicts the facts of reality is a negative estimate of the processes that led to it, and also of the effects the idea will have in practice, which have to be harmful. If one’s ideas are tied to reality at all and if one is guided by life as the standard, there is no way to identify an idea’s truth or falsehood without in some form also making such evaluations.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> [...] Truth is a product of effort and leads in action to value(s); hence, one says, the true idea is not only true: it is also good. Falsehood, assuming it reaches a certain scale, is a product of evasion and leads to destruction; such an idea is not only false; it is also evil.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> An employee, to take a relatively modest positive example, offers a man an idea for improving the operation of his business. His idea, the boss concludes after weighing the evidence, takes into account all the relevant facts; he’s right. So far, this is pure cognition, the outcome of which is expressed in a statement like: “I agree with you.” But no decent person, whether he knows philosophy or not, would stop there; he would not say unemotionally, like a dead fish: “Your idea is correct. Good day.”

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> On the contrary, precisely because the new idea represents a new grasp of reality, the moral kind of boss is enthusiastic, i.e., he *evaluates* the idea. He cannot avoid seeing two things: this employee of mine had to innovate, struggle, think to reach the idea when no one else did, and: the idea will cut my costs, increase my customers, double my profits.

---

<!-- _footer: Leonard Peikoff, *Fact and Value* -->

> The boss, accordingly, is excited, he likes his employee, he praises him, he rewards him. He not only says about the idea: “true.” As an inevitable corollary, he says about it: “good.” That “good” is the evaluation or the “ought”; it represents the practice of justice and the tie to life.
