# 1. The Nature of Law

---

<!-- _footer: Murray Rothbard, *The Logic of Action Two* -->

> If ethics is a normative discipline that identifies and classifies certain sets of actions as good or evil, right or wrong, then tort or criminal law is a subset of ethics identifying certain actions as appropriate for using violence against them. The law says that action $X$ should be illegal, and therefore *should* be combated by the violence of the law. The law is a set of “ought” or normative propositions.

---

# Law as a Subset of Ethics

---

## Law as a Normative Standard

---

## Law as a Normative Standard
 * Law identifies a group of criminals and a group of non-criminals
 * Law does not cover *every* normative question

---

## Law Deals with Justice

---

## Law Deals with Justice
 * Law prohibits that which is unjust and permits that which is just
 * To say that $X$ is just means to say that it can be argumentatively justified.
 * $\therefore$ law is a normative standard guiding men to just over unjust actions

---

## Justification as an Action

---

## Justification as an Action
 * Action is purposeful behaviour
 * The means a man employs in action is necessarily scarce
 * $\therefore$ in argumentative justification man has to concern himself with scarcity

---

## Scarcity $\longrightarrow$ Possible Conflicts

---

## Scarcity $\longrightarrow$ Possible Conflicts
 * Conflicts are contradictory actions
 * In a conflict one action excludes the other

---

## $\therefore$ Property Rights

---

## $\therefore$ Property Rights
 * Given the possibility for conflicts exclusive property rights must be assigned by law
 * Property rights define the just winner in a given conflict
 * Law identifies those in unjust direction (control) of a means as criminal in the conflict over said means
 * A property right in $\alpha$ held by $A$ means $A$ has the right to direct the use of $\alpha$

---

## A Position on Law is a Position on Ethics

---

## A Position on Law is a Position on Ethics
 * Ethics deals in general with evaluative philosophy
 * Law is the subset that deals with who should control what
 * Law is Ethics applied to conflicts
 * Law $\subset$ inter-personal Ethics, as against autistic Ethics

---

# The Failure of Legal Polylogism

---

## Legal Polylogism $\longrightarrow$ $p\wedge\neg p$

---

## Legal Polylogism $\longrightarrow$ $p\wedge\neg p$
 * For there to be different legal codes $A,\cdots,Z$, $A$ must be incompatible with the others
 * $A$ and $B$ incompatible on action $\alpha$
 * The legal-polylogist asserts that both $A$ *and* $B$ are correct.

---

## $\neg(p\wedge\neg p)$

---

## $\neg(p\wedge\neg p)$
 * Sally and Eric are in an argument over the truth of $p$
 * Eric says $p$, Sally says $\neg p$
 * Sally must pre-suppose that $p$ and $\neg p$ can't both be true
 * i.e. Sally pre-supposes the Law of Non-Contradiction, $\neg(p\wedge\neg p)$

---

# The Failure of Legal Positivism

---

<!-- _footer: Leslie Green and Thomas Adams, *The Stanford Encyclopædia of Philosophy* -->

> The positivist thesis does not say that law’s merits are unintelligible, unimportant, or peripheral to the philosophy of law. It says that they do not determine whether laws or legal systems *exist*. Whether a society has a legal system depends on the presence of certain structures of governance, not on the extent to which it satisfies ideals of justice, democracy, or the rule of law.

---

<!-- _footer: Leslie Green and Thomas Adams, *The Stanford Encyclopædia of Philosophy* -->

> What laws are in force in that system depends on what social standards its officials recognize as authoritative; for example, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, or social customs. The fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.).

---

## Legal Positivism as a non-Theory

---

## Legal Positivism as a non-Theory
 * The legal positivist is making the claim that law has nothing to do with justice
 * If $A$ is able to physically defeat $B$ in a conflict all the positivist says is "look, $A$ won the conflict, therefore the law on this conflict is that $A$ won."

---

## Further Problems with the Positivist Thesis

---

## Further Problems with the Positivist Thesis
 * Even if they accept might makes right they are in ruin
 * Might makes right is a polylogism

---

## Positivism and the Primacy of Consciousness

---

## Positivism and the Primacy of Consciousness
 * Rights simply are, they don't come from some consciousness whether divine, social, or individual
 * The logic of justification is the source of rights, not arbitrary thoughts

---

## Objective Law as a Science of Human Action

---

## Praxeology 101
 * Human action is purposeful behaviour
 * Prerequisites for action are (1) uneasiness, (2) an imagined state sans uneasiness and (3) the belief that action will bring about this state

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Causation and Aggression* -->

> In the context of legal analysis, one important praxeological doctrine is the distinction between action and mere behavior. The difference between action and behavior boils down to intent.

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Causation and Aggression* -->

> Action is an individual’s intentional intervention in the physical world, via certain selected means, with the purpose of attaining a state of affairs that is preferable to the conditions that would prevail in the absence of the action. Mere behavior, by contrast, is a person’s physical movements that are not undertaken intentionally and that do not manifest any purpose, plan, or design.

# Legislation vs Discovery

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Legislation and the Discovery of Law in a Free Society* -->

> In modern times the two dominant legal systems are the common law and the civil law. Based on the body of English case law that developed gradually over the centuries, the common law spread to English colonies and commonwealths like America, Canada, and Australia.

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Legislation and the Discovery of Law in a Free Society* -->

> Modern civil law systems are based on Roman law, which, like the common law, developed many of its important legal principles in the accumulated decisions of jurists in thousands of cases. Virtually all of Europe and many other jurisdictions, including Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and Quebec, have a civil-law system.

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Legislation and the Discovery of Law in a Free Society* -->

> In the common law and Roman law, there eventually evolved very sophisticated bodies of legal principles, concepts, methodology, and precedents. Because the classical common law and Roman law developed the large bulk of their legal principles through the decision and discussion of cases, they serve as rough examples of decentralized systems of “judge-found” law, as do largely private customary law systems like the Law Merchant.

## Types of Legal System

---

## Types of Legal System
 1. Those based on "judge-found" law
 2. Those based on legislative fiat

---

## Types of Legal System
 1. Those based on "judge-found" law
  -Roman Law
  -English common-law

 2. Those based on legislative fiat
  -Modern civil law

---

## Types of Legal System
 1. Those based on "judge-found" law
 -Roman Law
 -English common-law

 2. Those based on legislative fiat
 -Modern civil law
 -Judges are not attempting to do justice

---

## Judge-Found Law vs Legislative Fiat

---

## Judge-Found Law vs Legislative Fiat
 * Under judge-found law, the judges are setting out to do justice
 * Under fiat-law the "laws" are not rational
 * Arbitrary, subjective law is incopatible with justice
 * The judges can only accidentally make the right call
 * Compensation for victims is arbitrary and oft-ignored

---

## Fiat Law Tends to Legal Uncertainty

---

## Fiat Law Tends to Legal Uncertainty
 * Law as determined by arbitrary fiat can change at any moment
 * Under fiat-law there is no means for preventing contradiction between statutes
 * $\therefore$ it is potentially impossible to follow the law

---

## Summary

---

## Summary
 * The rational jurist discovers objective standards of law
 * The rational judge attempts to apply these standards to specific cases, he attempts to *do justice*
 * Anarcho-Capitalism does *not* consist of multi-centralised law
 * Existence (objective reality) must be at the core, not arbitrary whim
