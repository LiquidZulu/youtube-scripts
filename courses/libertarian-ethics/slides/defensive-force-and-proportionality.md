# 6. Defensive Force and Proportionality

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Punishment and Proportionality: The Estoppel Approach* -->

> No doubt punishment serves many purposes. It can deter crime and prevent the offender from committing further crimes. Punishment can even rehabilitate some criminals, if it is not capital. It can satisfy a victim’s longing for revenge, or his relatives’ desire to avenge. Punishment can also be used as a lever to gain restitution, recompense for some of the damage caused by the crime. For these reasons, the issue of punishment is, and always has been, of vital concern to civilized people. They want to know the effects of punishment and effective ways of carrying it out.

# The Just Means of Punishment

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Punishment and Proportionality: The Estoppel Approach* -->

> [First,] [w]hat does it mean to punish? Dictionary definitions are easy to come by, but in the sense that interests those of us who want to punish, punishment is the infliction of physical force on a person, in response to something that he has done or has failed to do. Punishment thus comprises physical violence committed against a person’s body, or against any other property that a person legitimately owns, against any rights that a person has.

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Punishment and Proportionality: The Estoppel Approach* -->

> Punishment is for, or in response to, some action, inaction, feature, or status of the person punished; otherwise, it is simply random violence, which is not usually considered to be punishment. Thus when we punish a person, it is because we consider him to be a wrongdoer of some sort. We typically want to teach him or others a lesson, or exact vengeance or restitution, for what he has done.

---

## The Theory of Dialogical Estoppel

---

## The Theory of Dialogical Estoppel
 * The issue of justifying a punishment only arises if the wrongdoer rejects the justice of the punishment
 * A person cannot forward contradictory claims in an argument, he is estopped

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Punishment and Proportionality: The Estoppel Approach* -->

> To say that a person is estopped from making certain claims means that the claims cannot even possibly be right, because they are contradictory. It is to recognize that his assertion is simply wrong because it is contradictory.

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Punishment and Proportionality: The Estoppel Approach* -->

> Applying estoppel in such a manner perfectly complements the very purpose of dialogue. Dialogue […] is by its nature an activity aimed at finding truth. Anyone engaged in argument is necessarily endeavoring to discern the truth about some particular subject; to the extent this is not the case, there is no dialogue occurring, but mere babbling or even physical fighting.

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella, *Punishment and Proportionality: The Estoppel Approach* -->

> Nor can this be denied. Anyone engaging in argument long enough to deny that truth is the goal of discourse contradicts himself, because he is himself asserting or challenging the truth of a given proposition. Thus, the assertion as true of anything that simply cannot be true is incompatible with the very purpose of discourse. Anything that cannot be true is contrary to the truth-finding purpose of discourse, and thus is not permissible within the bounds of the discourse.

# Applying Estoppel

---

# Applying Estoppel
 * $A$ punches $B$
 * $B$ wants to punch $A$ back as punishment
 * $A$ can't reject this punishment without contradiction
 * Proportionality—eye for an eye, not an eye for a tooth

---

# The Objection from Particularisation

---

# The Objection from Particularisation
 * $A$ claims that his positions are that $A$ punching $B$ is permissible and that it is impermissible for anyone to punch $A$
 * Norms must be universalisable

---

<!-- _footer: Hans-Hermann Hoppe (1988), *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism* -->

> Quite commonly it has been observed that argumentation implies that a proposition claims universal acceptability, or, should it be a norm proposal, that it is “universalizable.” Applied to norm proposals, this is the idea, as formulated in the Golden Rule of ethics or in the Kantian Categorical Imperative, that only those norms can be justified that can be formulated as general principles which are valid for everyone without exception.

---

# Against Particularism

---

# Against Particularism
 * An argumentatively valid proposition must in principle be valid no matter who it is proposed to
 * Any rejection of this implies a polylogism

---

<!-- _footer: N. Stephan Kinsella (1996), *Punishment and Proportionality: The Estoppel Approach* -->

> An arguer cannot escape the application of estoppel by arbitrarily specializing his otherwise-inconsistent views with liberally-sprinkled “for me only’s.”

---

## Particularism Begets Particularism

---

# The Objection from Changing One's Mind

---

# The Objection from Changing One's Mind
 * If changing one's mind makes one no longer responsible $B$ can defend his punishment thusly
 * By changing his mind $A$ is denouncing his prior aggression
 * Mind-changing is a form of particularisation

---

## Mind-Changing as Particularisation
 * $A$ is asserting that they believe the punching is illegitimate
 * At the moment of the assault $A$ must pre-suppose that punching is legitimate
 * $A$ *cannot* drop the pre-supposition that punching is legitimate, he can't undo his action
 * $A$ can *only* drop the challenge

---

# Mens Rea vs Actus Reus

---

# Mens Rea vs Actus Reus
 * Mens rea means guilty mind
 * Actus reus means guilty act
 * Restitution requires actus reus, retribution requires mens rea

---

# The Just Means of Defense

---

# The Just Means of Defense
 * A property right in $X$ held by $A$ implies the right of $A$ to exclude other people from the use of $X$
 * $\therefore$ $A$ is permitted to use whatever means are required to go about excluding people from $X$
 * You are permitted to possess the body and other means of an invader to the extent that this is required to exclude them from their invasion

---

# The Human-Body Sword and the Human-Body Shield

---

# The Human-Body Sword and the Human-Body Shield
 * You can damage your neighbors sword or body if this is required to exclude an aggressive invasion

---

<!-- _footer: Kris Borer (2010), *The Human Body Sword* -->

> The situation is superficially different if, instead of attacking you with stolen property, the criminal instead shields himself with stolen property. For example, say the criminal wraps himself in your neighbor’s quilt, approaches you and then begins shooting at you. As you take cover and draw your sidearm, your neighbor yells, “Don’t shoot my quilt!” As a libertarian, must you respect the preference of your neighbor? Will stolen cars and tuxedos become the bane of libertarian police forces?

# The Libertarian Solution to Human-Body Shields

---

<!-- _footer: Kris Borer (2010), *The Human Body Sword* -->

> An equivalent situation would be if the attacking criminal had connected a device to your neighbor that would kill him if the criminal were to die. If you defend yourself against the criminal, then your neighbor will suffer. Yet, as in the previous case, your rights are antecedent to those of your neighbor. The aggressor brought his property into conflict.

---

<!-- _footer: Kris Borer (2010), *The Human Body Sword* -->

> The violation of your neighbor’s property rights occurs when the criminal connects the device to him, and when the criminal attacks you, not when you kill the criminal. Furthermore, your neighbor would not be justified in attacking you to try and prevent you from killing the criminal.
