# 4. Contract Theory

---

<!-- _footer: Murray Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> The right of property implies the right to make contracts about that property: to give it away or to exchange titles of ownership for the property of another person. Unfortunately, many libertarians, devoted to the right to make contracts, hold the contract itself to be an absolute, and therefore maintain that any voluntary contract whatever must be legally enforceable in the free society.

---

# The Title-Transfer Theory of Contracts

---

# The Title-Transfer Theory of Contracts
 * Property rights are conflict-avoiding norms
 * The owner is the one who justly controls a given resource
 * The owner can abandon the property or transfer title
 * Abandonment must be objective and intersubjectively ascertainable

---

## The Basic Contract

---

## The Basic Contract
 * For it to be a transfer, Crusoe must relinquish control at the same time that Friday takes up control
 * There is no time between Crusoe and Friday's ownership where the stick is unowned
 * A transfer of title to the stick involves Crusoe abandoning it at the same time that Friday homesteads it
 * If Crusoe does not relinquish the stick he has implicitly stolen it

---

## Conditional Transfers

---

## Conditional Transfers
 * Crusoe agrees to transfer title to the stick to Friday on the condition that Friday performs a dance
 * When Friday does the dance he owns the stick
 * Crusoe is "estopped"
 * A contract is not a piece of paper, the piece of paper is *evidence of* the contract

---

## Contracts Are Never Broken

---

## Contracts Are Never Broken
 * If $A$ and $B$ agree that $B$ will transfer to $A$ a sum of 10 ounces of silver on the condition that $A$ performs magic at $B$’s birthday party, $A$ has not violated $B$’s rights by not showing up
 * The only possible aggression with respect to contracts is theft of property retained

---

## A Final Example
 * Smith agrees to pay 50 lbs of gold for Jones' car
 * Smith takes the car but refuses to hand over the 50 lbs of gold
 * What has Smith stolen?
 * If Smith has 50 lbs he has stolen it
 * If Smith lacks 50 lbs he has stolen the car

---

# Fraud

---

# FRB as Fraud

---

# FRB as Fraud
 * The FRB keeps only some fraction of the money
 * Under full reserve there is a one-to-one correspondence between money certificates and money
 * Under fractional reserve there are more certificates than actual money
 * More property titles than actual property implies fraud

---

# Against Free Bankers

---

# Against Free Bankers
 * Property theory lies antecedent to contract theory
 * A fractional reserve casino game is fine, a fractional reserve *bank* is not

---

# Debtors Prison

---

# Debtors Prison
 * If $A$ loans $B$ 1000oz silver in exchange for 1050oz in one years time but $B$ defaults has he stolen from $A$?
 * Would $A$ be permitted to put $B$ to work in a debtors prison to pay off this stolen sum?
 * If $B$ has stolen, *what* has he stolen? 1000oz or 1050oz?
 * Can't be 1000oz, as that was transferred to him
 * Can't be 1050oz either, because it doesn't exist

---

## How to Make Aleatory Contracts

---

## How to Make Aleatory Contracts
 * $A$ can bake in an interest clause
 * It is not the role of law to make sure $A$ makes a profit, some loans go bad

---

# Voluntary Slavery

---

<!-- _footer: Walter Block, *Toward a Libertarian Theory of Inalienability: A Critique of Rothbard, Barnett, Smith, Kinsella, Gordon, and Epstein*. -->

> The underlying point of the libertarian critique is that if I own something, I can sell it (and should be allowed by law to do so). If I can’t sell it, then, and to that extent, I really don’t own it. Take my own liberty as perhaps the paradigm case of the debate over inalienability.

---

<!-- _footer: Walter Block, *Toward a Libertarian Theory of Inalienability: A Critique of Rothbard, Barnett, Smith, Kinsella, Gordon, and Epstein*. -->

> The claim is that if I really own my liberty, then I should be free to dispose of it as I please, even if, by so doing, I end up no longer owning it. Clearly, since I cannot own a square circle, I cannot sell it. If I can own my own ability to give true love, then I can sell it; if I logically cannot own this attribute, then, of course, I cannot give, barter, or sell it to anyone else.

---

<!-- _footer: Walter Block, *Toward a Libertarian Theory of Inalienability: A Critique of Rothbard, Barnett, Smith, Kinsella, Gordon, and Epstein*. -->

> My thesis: No law should be enacted prohibiting or even limiting in any way people’s rights to alienate those things they own. This is “full monte” alienability, or commodification.

---

## Prerequisites for Voluntary Slavery

---

## Prerequisites for Voluntary Slavery
 * You must be able to own yourself
 * You must be able to sell yourself
 * Block contends that nothing is ownable that is not also sellable

---

<!-- _footer: Murray Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> The distinction between a man’s alienable labor service and his inalienable will may be further explained; a man can alienate his labor service, but he cannot sell the capitalized future value of that service. In short, he cannot, in nature, sell himself into slavery and have this sale enforced—for this would mean that his future will over his own person was being surrendered in advance.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> In short, a man can naturally expend his labor currently for someone else’s benefit, but he cannot transfer himself, even if he wished, into another man’s permanent capital good. For he cannot rid himself of his own will, which may change in future years and repudiate the current arrangement.

---

<!-- _footer: Murray Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* -->

> The concept of “voluntary slavery” is indeed a contradictory one, for so long as a laborer remains totally subservient to his master’s will voluntarily, he is not yet a slave since his submission is voluntary; whereas, if he later changed his mind and the master enforced his slavery by violence, the slavery would not then be voluntary.

---

## The Blockean Response

---

## The Blockean Response
 * The frontal lobotomy as will-surrender
 * Voluntary slavery is a mere technological limitation, not a legal one
 * Will isn't relevant, its possible to have slaves

---

## The Blockean Mistake

---

## The Blockean Mistake
 * A human body is necessarily and objectively linked to an acting man
 * The nature of argumentation implies a mutual recognition of self-ownership

---

<!-- _footer: Walter Block, *Rejoinder to Kinsella on Ownership* -->

> Let us posit you have a dog who is heart and soul with you. K9 dogs are said to have this sort of connection with their masters. According to Kinsella, not only would it be illegal to sell this dog [...] but, also, well-nigh logically impossible for this to occur. Just as we all “have the best link to my body”, you, too, have the best link to this dog.

---

<!-- _footer: Walter Block, *Rejoinder to Kinsella on Ownership* -->

> You snap your fingers, and the dog does your bidding, not that of the neighbor, to whom you have sold the dog. The point is, “the best link to, in terms of control,” is clearly way outside the bounds of libertarian homesteading and property rights theory. Merely because someone has “the best link” to something, does not mean he is necessarily the legitimate owner of it [...]

---

## Block's Failure
 * Disanalogy!
 * The dog is an external object, not a (human) body
 * $A$ wants to sell a dog to $B$ is a case of either $A$ or $B$ "coercing" the dog to do their bidding
 * Selling requires abandonment

---

## Rothbard Vindicated

---

## Rothbard Vindicated
 * Whether you can literally transfer the will isn't directly relevant
 * Consent in the present does not imply consent in the future
 * Destroying the will would allow for body-transfer if it renders one braindead

---

## Ownership $\centernot\longrightarrow$ The Right to Sell

---

## Ownership $\centernot\longrightarrow$ The Right to Sell
 * Ownership is the right to control a scarce resource, it takes an additional step to say that you can give up that right
 * Conflation between legal and catallactic ownership
 * I can sell a bitcoin, or idea, or labour without owning these things
