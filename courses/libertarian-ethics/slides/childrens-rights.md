# 5. The Rights of Children

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> From its inception, libertarian theory has had an enormous problem standing before it: how to reconcile the existence of developing self-owners within the framework of property rights and non-aggression. It is not at all obvious how the rights of children, or lack thereof, are to be derived from the aforementioned principles.

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> It is all too easy for subjective cultural values concerning children to sneak their way into an otherwise sound argument. In order to develop a rational theory on this topic, these seemingly self-evident attitudes must be identified and dismissed. Similarly, it is imperative to reject the “wisdom of repugnance” which would dismiss a rational theory solely on the grounds that it produces conclusions abhorrent to the popular mores of a given society.

# The Groundwork

---

# The Groundwork
 * It is psychological rather than physiological immaturity that defines a child
 * A person can go in and out of childhood during their life
 * The man passed out in the snow is a child in the legal sense
 * The right of guardianship is a property right
 * Childhood is the inability to express your will

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> [...] imagine the scenario of an encrypted last testament (being consequentially analogous to one’s premature will), which an interested party agrees to decrypt over time. What is to be done with the estate during that time? It must doubtless not be damaged or consumed until such a time as the will has been entirely decrypted, with its voluntary manager responsible for preserving it in the interim.

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> Should it be damaged or consumed during that period, either by the manager or by a third party, whoever has done such damage or consumption would be held liable, and that person would be disqualified from managing the property in the future, provided that someone else is willing to assume that role.

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> As such, anyone who harms a child should be held liable for the damage done and be forbidden from being the guardian of that child in the future, provided that someone else is willing to assume that role. As bits and pieces of the will are decrypted, the estate manager would be obligated to follow any instructions which are capable of being understood with the information available at the time.

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> As such, as a child develops, his guardian is obligated to relinquish authority over to the child in domains of behavior which the child can express his informed will on. In a contention between a child and his guardian over such authority, a court can listen to the testimony of the child in order to determine if he truly understands that which he is saying, or if he is merely blathering on about a decision which he lacks the comprehension necessary to make.

## Preservation of the Childs Natural Form

---

## Preservation of the Childs Natural Form
 * Life-saving surgery preserves the childs natural form, so its just
 * Cosmetic surgery such as circumcision is unjust because you don't know what the child's will is on this topic
 * The guardian is "the owner of the exclusive right to raise that child."<sup>4</sup>

---

## Abandonment of Guardianship

---

## Abandonment of Guardianship
 * Because the guardian owns the exclusive right to protect the child any abuse performed by him implies an abandonment of this right
 * Adoption agencies must be notified because the abandonment has to be inter-subjectively ascertainable
 * Not notifying would be forestalling

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> Since a child’s preferences cannot be known, the proper method of raising him is impossible to determine, so his guardian is largely free to engage in any actions that he wishes to in relation to the child, as long as he does not deprive him of his innate function or form.

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> While refusing to feed (or care for in other ways) a child cannot be understood as an act of harm, since the resources required for such care belong to the guardian and not the child, it still constitutes an abandonment of guardianship rights, but cannot carry a penalty other than one for forestalling. Rather, harm in this context can only be rendered by an active (rather than passive) behavior on the part of an adult against a child. This rules out any form of neglect.

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> There must be a direct causal link between the action and the effects suffered for it to be considered harmful. For instance, saving photographs of the child in amusing outfits has no plausible benefit and may bring about a negative response from him when he has grown up, but this cannot be considered damaging, as no act within the photoshoot itself deprived him of anything, and any potential maleffects are suffered entirely in retrospect, so they are not relevant to the act itself.

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> In contrast, verifiable psychological damage suffered by a child, which is directly attributable to an act of torment inflicted on him by an adult, deprives him of his natural mental functioning which is innately his. This also applies to physiological damage, of which verification and attribution is considerably easier. Any scarring, maiming, mutilation, or other disfigurement, which deprives a child of his innate body, and was suffered as a result of actions taken against him by an adult, likewise qualifies as damage.

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> The exception to this would be surgical procedures (or, conceivably, other acts) that treat conditions which pose a greater threat to a child’s innate health than the damage associated with the procedures themselves. A life-threatening cancer, for example, warrants treatments of increasing severity up to the point of death. In contrast, genetic abnormalities (or, in the case of certain ritual practices such as circumcision, normalities) that benefit only the outward appearance of a child may not be corrected via damaging surgery.

---

<!-- _footer: Ian Hersum, *A Rational Theory of the Rights of Children* -->

> Similarly, operations which seek to improve the functioning of a child beyond his natural capacity by replacing parts of his body may not be performed, unless such modification is necessary to treat a threatening health condition (such as the amputation of a severely damaged limb). As the preference of a child for these alterations cannot be known, the preservation of his natural form is required by default, giving way only to prevent further damage from occurring.

## A Baby, not a Parasite
 * Every human is a clump of cells, this is irrelevant to ethics
 * The baby has rights at conception
 * The potential human is the matter prior to conception, after conception its an actual human

> Compare two entities […]: one, the new-born babe, still attached to its umbilical chord, a few seconds old. The other, its sibling, is still in the womb but due out in a matter of minutes. No two entities could be more alike, biologically, spiritually, or in any other way. Yet, in the “pro-choice” philosophy, it would be murder to kill the one and a matter of complete judicial irrelevance to kill the other. Surely, this is a travesty not only of justice but also of common sense.

 * The mother is not allowed to directly harm the baby
 * The mother can evict, but not arbitrarily murder her baby
 * The mother must notify potential adopters
 * Both pro-life and pro-abortion are flawed

## The Bounds of the Body
 * At conception the material that makes up the baby's body is transferred from the mother and father to the child
 * Mere physical connection is a poor criterion for the confines of the body
 * The body is a composition of organs which behave cohesively under a single will<sup>6</sup>
